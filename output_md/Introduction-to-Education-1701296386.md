## Textbook

The  book  'Introduction  to  Education'  was  written  to  be  used  as a resource in introductory education courses.   We want students who are first exploring the field of education to get answers to some of their most common questions.  Thus, we have broken up the book into the following questions:

- Why teach?
- What is the purpose of school?
- Who are today's students?
- How do social issues affect students?
- What is taught?

Purpose of the

- What makes an effective teacher?
- What is a positive classroom environment?
- What are the ethical and legal issues in schools?
- What is an educational philosophy?
- Excellence or equity…which is more important?
- What can a new teacher expect?

## How to Use this Book

Each  chapter  provides  objectives  and  key  terms  that  guide  the content.  The chapter often contains an interactive question as well as  video  content  that  could  be  used  to  explore  content  in  more depth.   At the very end of many chapters, additional readings are suggested.  This can be helpful as an instructor or a student may want  to  include  content  that  is  aligned  with  the  state  education challenges and requirements.

If  you  are  a  student  exploring this topic, you can use this book as  a  springboard  for  further  learning  about  education.   In  many cases,  clear  examples  are  provided  in  each  chapter  to  allow  for clarification.

## PART I FOUNDATIONS OF SCHOOLS AND THEIR STUDENTS

## 1. Why Teach?

JENNIFER BEASLEY AND MYRA HAULMARK

![Image](output_md\Introduction-to-Education-1701296386_artifacts\image_000004_6c90f2adb78178053d26bf0b8203e785d1a3a8d9500193d05cc77c53cfb7efdb.png)

Why do teachers teach? It is a rather simple question, however,  the  question  of  what is a teacher must be addressed first. Merriam-Webster's definition  of  a teacher is  'one whose occupation is to instruct' (Merriam-Webster,

2008,  para.  1).  That  is  a  rather  one-dimensional  definition  of  a teacher, as teachers these days offer so much more to the class than just the information; they offer themselves. A collective definition of a  teacher  is  someone  who  'yearns  to  help  children  learn,  watch them grow, and make a meaningful difference in the world' (Teacher Support Network, 2007, para. 2). This definition must be the main reason why individuals pursue teaching as a career. Generally, the pay is low to fair, but the overall rewards are much greater.  As a teacher, one can touch the hearts of the young and open their minds to tap their thirst for knowledge.

Objectives and Key Terms

In this chapter, readers will…

- Understand that the decision to teach is motivated by both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards
- Identify reasons for teaching
- Define the role of a teacher in current society

Key terms in the chapter are…

- Intrinsic reward
- Extrinsic reward
- Teacher
- Compensation
- Benefits

## The Educator Pathway

There are multiple pathways to becoming a teacher, but it can be a lengthy process no matter the pathway.  In the state of Arkansas, for example, a traditional teaching pathway requires that you have at  least  a  Bachelor's  Degree,  as  well  as  pass  certification  tests. There are other alternative pathways as well, but many of you are taking your first step by taking an introductory course in education. Sometimes a first step on the pathway to a career is to decide on the level you wish to teach, Elementary or Secondary, as well as your academic subject major(s) and/or minor(s).  All of your coursework at any university will depend on the level you wish to teach and your major and/or minor.

Arkansas has several certification levels.  They are:

- Birth to Kindergarten
- Kindergarten through 6
- Grades 6 through 8

## · Grades 7 through 12

More information can be found on the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education website.

As  you  consider  the  grades  you  are  looking  to  teach,  consider these certification bands.  Talking with an advisor at your chosen four-year  university  will  help  you  decide  what  may  be  best  for you.  Each university will have its own requirements.  Some of them will require you to spend a certain number of hours working with students  before  you  can  apply  for  acceptance  into  the  program. Other universities may require you to write an admission essay.   At this stage in your development, you should sit down with an advisor from the university you wish to attend.  They will be able to map out a course for you so that you make the best use of your time and money and know the process for acceptance into their university.

Teaching is not often sought after for the salary,  but one with long hours and a flat rate of pay. The income, of course, depends on where the teacher is instructing. Private schools, parochial schools, and  charter  schools,  in  general,  tend  to  have  lower  pay  scales. This is  because they may not have the same revenue base as the public schools.  An educator's compensation (what is rewarded for a  service)  can  include  money  as  well  as  benefits  such  as  health insurance  and  retirement.   This  compensation  can  vary  across states and countries.

## 2018-2019 Teacher Salary Benchmark Report or Educator Pay and State Spending

However,  educators  may  choose  to  teach  in  these  schools because  of  the  schools'  philosophy,  religious  preferences,  or  a variety of other reasons.  Regardless of the reason, most educators will  agree  they  went  into  teaching  because  they  have  the  desire to  spread  knowledge,  and/or  to  watch  children  reach  their  full potential.

## Reasons for Teaching: Intrinsic and Extrinsic Rewards

Researchers have identified a set of occupational rewards that can help  us  determine  the  qualities  that  might  attract  people  to  a teaching  career  (Feiman-Nemser  &amp;  Floden,  1986).   These  rewards can be categorized as either extrinsic or intrinsic.

Extrinsic rewards are those that are more public such as money, prestige, and power.  Intrinsic rewards are those discussed in the earlier  part  of  the  chapter.  They  are  more  internal,  such  as satisfaction with a job well done, or the enjoyment of the work itself. The rewards received by being a teacher are different than those received  by  someone  like  a  salesman,  for  example.   If  a  salesman is doing well, he makes his quota, and he then earns his monetary bonus.  He may receive a plaque to hang behind his desk stating that he was the number one salesman for this period in time.

Intrinsic  rewards  are  more  internal  rewards.  Teachers'  rewards are  not  so  tangible,  but  rather,  'They  are  rewarded  more  by witnessing their students succeed and follow their dreams than by any plaque ' (Daily Egyptian, 2005).  A group of school teachers who had participated  in  a  study  that  looked  into  why  teachers  taught in  high-challenge  schools,  jointly  agreed  that  what  their  students achieved under their instruction was rewarded enough for all the time that they devote to their students.  'Student achievement was another  reward  the  teachers  discussed  as  a  reason  for  staying. When their students were successful, the teachers felt incredibly rewarded.' (Morris, 2007, pg 58).  The reward teachers receive is a feeling, and feelings are more special and memorable than gold and silver  plaques  hung  stoically  on  a  wall  proclaiming  an  individual's success.  For teaching, it is not about what the teachers can achieve, but what they can get their students to achieve, and through their students, reflect a teacher's greatest achievement.

## Reasons for Teaching: Passion, Love, and Creativity

## Passion

There  are  multiple  factors  in  deciding  to  become  a  teacher.   For one, it is a healthy alternative to other professions as the Training Development Agency's (TDA) research has found that about twice as many teachers truly enjoy their work, as opposed to those who have careers in marketing, IT, and accounting (TDA, In Summary, para. 1). Work is not truly work, if it is enjoyed.  For example, Beth Ashfield, a math teacher, spoke of her job with passion, 'I love my subject, but I know it's not socially acceptable to say that… in school, I  can  be  as  enthusiastic  as  I  want  to  be.  I'm  able  to  convey  that enthusiasm to the students, to allow them to become confident and creative in their approach to the subject' (TDA, Beth Ashfield, Maths teacher, para. 1).  Becoming a teacher was important for her, due to her great love of a particular subject, and the desire to share it with others in hopes that they might discover the same for themselves. As a teacher, one is always learning, whether it is of one's content material or something new from a pupil.  Being a teacher requires an open mind, for the teacher is always the student.  A teacher guides his or her charges on a path to self-discovery where they can learn about the world, and ultimately, themselves.

## Love

Beyond passion, another reason that teachers teach is simply for the love of teaching.  As stated by (Liston &amp; Garrison, 2003) Love is a 'creative, critical, and disruptive force in teaching and learning.'  A teacher who loves his or her job will be a better teacher and have

a greater impact on the students he or she influences.  Classroom efforts  to  manage,  instruct  and  direct  groups  of  twenty  to  thirty students frequently require a feeling for others and an intuition that connects teacher to student and subject matter (Liston &amp; Garrison, 2003).   For  the  new  teacher,  the  multiple  tasks  entailed  in  this activity  can  be  overwhelming.  (Liston  &amp;  Garrison,  2003)   For  the experienced teacher, they can seem almost unconscious (Liston &amp; Garrison, 2003).  Most teachers truly have passion for what they do, but they also have a love for it as well.

## Creativity

![Image](output_md\Introduction-to-Education-1701296386_artifacts\image_000007_764468c41b9639cec0e84c8c9081e56fd2f5f14651151e641ace7341176d1a76.png)

'Every  person  is  unique  and the challenge is to find fun ways to guide individuals to learn and understand what they are interested in learning' (B. Anders, personal communication, February 2, 2008). There are many ways to be  creative  in  the  classroom, whether  it  is using  projects, videos,  and  presentations,  but what if the creativity stemmed from the teacher?

Being creative is important in teaching,  for  the  students  are the audience.

rather dull aspects of education.  This in  and  of  itself  is  talent,  and  some devote themselves to that. Paul Keogh, a Modern Languages teacher, had always aspired to be an entertainer, however, he chose teaching  as  his  profession  instead. He equated teaching to entertainment, but more importantly, he remarks, 'I love to see  them growing personally, socially and academically' (TDA, Paul Keogh, Modern Languages teacher, para. 3). This statement  itself  encompasses the point of education, for there cannot be growth without learning.

## Why do teachers teach?

To  address  the  opening  question,  'Why  do  teachers  teach?',  the answer  is  simple;  'They  teach  for  the  love  of  children  and  to contribute to the well-being of all of us' (Teachers are Important, 1998,  para.  4).   It  is  something  inside  them.  It  is  a  drive,  a  force, a passion, a talent that they wish to dispel upon their students to watch them succeed.  Choosing to be a teacher is not for the money, as a teacher's monetary compensation is hardly adequate given all that they give to their students.  Becoming a teacher is almost like heeding a calling.  It is not for the light at heart, but rather, for those who love children and people, who have a passion for education, and who love to share in that passion.  Teachers yearn to see the burning desire to learn and love to see the excitement of discovery, and that is why teachers teach.

## 2. What is the Purpose of School?

## What is the Purpose of School?

What is the purpose of school?  Neil Postman said that 'without a purpose, schools are houses of detention, not attention' (1995, p. 7).   Most countries have systems of formal education and many of these are compulsory.  Although the names of schools differ, most include a primary school for young children and a secondary school for teenagers (Roser &amp; Oritz-Ospina, 2019).

## Objectives and Key Terms

## In this chapter, readers will…

- Understand the basic purposes of school
- Describe several different understandings of the concept of 'school'
- Define the nature of school for each level: elementary, middle, and high schools

## Key terms in the chapter are…

- Compulsory
- Formal Education
- Informal Education
- Vocational

## Defining School

Before  landing  upon  a  definition  for  school,  it  is  important  to delineate the differences between education and schooling.

Education  is  a  process  of  learning  and  growing  as  one  gains understanding  about  the  surrounding  world.   This  is  a  lifelong process.  It  is,  as  John  Dewey  (1916)  put  it,  a  social  process  -  'a process of living and not a preparation for future living.'

Schooling can often look like an institution with a very specific

motive  -  drill  learning  into  people  according  to  some  plan  often drawn up by others. Paulo Friere (1973) famously called this banking -  making  deposits  of  knowledge.   This  type  of  'schooling'  treats learners like objects.

## School Culture

What  makes  a  good  school  culture?   Shafer  (2018)  noted  that  it is  all  about  connections.  She  describes  five  interwoven  elements that  support  school  structure,  1)  Fundamental  beliefs,  2)  Shared values, 3) Norms (how people believe they should act), 4) Patterns and behaviors, and 5) Tangible evidence. To read more about those elements, you can find the article here: https:/ /www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/18/07/what-makesgood-school-culture

'In a strong culture, there are many, overlapping, and cohesive interactions among all members of the organization.'

- Leah Shafer

## Purposes of School

## Is School for Knowledge?

If  asked,  most  people  would  say  that  the  purpose  of  school  is  to provide knowledge, but the question becomes what knowledge and

who should decide. Is learning for the sake of learning what school is about? Learning expands the mind and school is a way for students to be exposed to different ideas and concepts. Knowledge obtained through  school  can  provide  students  with  a  sense  of  personal fulfillment (Education).

'It seems to me, that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the legitimate goals of his life.'

- -Martin Luther King Jr (1947)

It is argued that anything learned in school could be learned on your own (Gatto, 2005). In the modern-day of the Internet and with vast libraries of knowledge available to us, this is very true. There then becomes a problem of motivation. What would make someone want to learn math or science? Does a child just decide someday that they want to learn all about Chemistry? (Postman, 1995) It is not an issue of what information is necessary, but an issue of exposing students to different ideas that they can choose to grow and build on. It is teaching them how to learn. Education should expose students to information  and  teach  them  how  to  think,  not  tell  them  what  to think. Martin Luther King Jr said, 'Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction' (1947).

## Is School for Getting a Job?

Not  everyone  has  the  opportunities  or  wants  to  go  to  college. Therefore, the purpose of school must be to give students the skills to  get  a  job.  This  means  that  education  is  a  way  for  anyone  to support  him  or  herself  and  economically  contribute  to  society (Education).   Some of these skills are taught in many of the basic classes:  reading,  writing,  and  arithmetic.  There  is  also  vocational education,  which  is  extremely  important  to  the  lives  of  students who do not enjoy academia. Just because a student does not like school does not mean that the school should ignore them. It is the school's responsibility to educate all students and prepare them for their future.

## Is School for Socialization?

It is argued that any of the above items can be learned on your own (Gatto, 2005). As stated earlier, the issue of motivation and outside circumstances does provide a problem with this theory, but what can replace the socialization that a student receives in school?

'Schooling at its best can be about how to make a life, which is quite different from how to make a living' (Postman, 1995, p. x).

Einstein  said  that  the  school's  responsibility  is  to  educate  the individual as a free individual but to also educate them to be part of society (Haselhurst, 2007). Students are around hundreds of people their  own  age  and  this  teaches  them  how  to  act  in  society  and

how to communicate. This is helpful no matter what they do with their future and nothing can replace those skills. Being in a school with  that  many  people  also  exposes  the  student  to  people  who are  different  from  him  or  herself  and  this  is  extremely  helpful  in anyone's  development as a human being and a better member of society  (Postman,  1995).  Professor  Nel  Noddings  said  that  the school's aim is 'to produce competent, caring, loving, and lovable people' (Kohn, 2004, p.2).

## Types of Schools

In most states, the school year is 180 days. School days often last a total of six and a half hours.  This means that a child may spend more than 1,000 hours in school each year.  In elementary school, how  are  these  hours  typically  spent?   In  these  sections,  we  will discuss the teacher's role, what students experience in elementary, middle school, and high school.

## Elementary

An  elementary  school  is  the  main  point  of  delivery  of  primary education for children between 5-11.  In elementary school, children are exposed to a broad range of topics and often remain together in  one  classroom.  School  districts  and  the  state  determine  the curriculum, but generally, a student learns basic arithmetic, English proficiency, social studies, science, physical development, and fine arts.

## The Role of the Teacher

An elementary school teacher is trained with an emphasis on human cognitive and psychological development as well as the principles of  curriculum development and instruction.  Teachers earn either a  Bachelors  or  Master's  degree  in  Early  Childhood  or  Elementary Education.

The public elementary teacher typically instructs between twenty and thirty students of diverse learning needs.  These teachers use a  variety  of  ways  to  teach,  with  a  focus  on  student  engagement (getting a student's attention).

## What Students Experience

Originally,  an  elementary  school  was  synonymous  with  primary education.   Many  students  prior  to  World  War  I  did  not  attend school  past  Grade  8.   Over  the  past  few  decades,  schools  in  the USA have seen numbers of high school graduates rise and with it, changes in what students experience in school.

An elementary school typically contained one-teacher, one-class models, but this has been changing over time.  Multi-age programs, where children in different grades share the same classroom and teachers.  Another  alternative  is  that  children  might  have  a  main class and go to another teacher's room for one subject.  This could be called a rotation and it is similar to the concept of teams found in junior high school.

## Middle School

Watch  the  following  video  from  the  perspective  of  a  middle

schooler.  What would you point out as part of her environment at school? Is there any evidence of her relationship with what she is learning or her relationship with educators at her school?

## High School

While there is no set standard for an American high school, some generalizations  can  be  made  about  the  majority.   Schools  are managed  by  local,  elected  school  districts.   Students  ages  14-18 participate  in  four  years  of  school.   School  years  are  normally around nine months and are broken up into quarters or semesters. The High School curriculum is defined in terms of Carnegie Units, which approximate 120 class contact hours within a year.  No two schools will be the same, and no two students will have the same classes.   There  are  some  general  core  subjects,  but  electives  will vary by school.

## 3. Who are Today's Students?

JENNIFER BEASLEY AND MYRA HAULMARK

## Who Are Today's Students?

We  have  all  spent  time  as  students,  and  our  teachers  had  their opinions of us. Some of those opinions may have been based in fact and some of them may have been based in their own prejudice and bias. We have to accept students for who they are, where they come from,  and  the  circumstances  of  their  life.  We  have  to  keep  our personal bias and prejudice out of the classroom. If we do not we will,  even  if  we  don't  realize it, treat  them  in  a  way  that  may have  a  negative  impact  on  the learning environment and their learning.

It  is  known  that  in  order  to learn, we have to take a risk. According to Erikson's 'Stages of Social Development,' if the circumstances are positive, we develop a sense of  autonomy  during  our  toddler  years.  Autonomy  is  the  feeling/ belief that we can do things, we can take care of ourselves, and we can do for ourselves. The next stage which we enter around three years  old  is  where  we  develop  the  initiative.  We  try  new  things, explore, and experiment. It is during both of these stages that we take many risks.  Autonomy and initiative are major foundations for the learning process.

Who are today's students? We understand that we all come from different family structures and socio-cultural backgrounds. Understanding these differences helps an educator to better meet the needs of the classroom.

## Objectives and Key Terms

## In this chapter, readers will…

- Discuss the predominant issues and societal trends confronting contemporary education.
- Identify diversity and how it impacts education
- Explain how the role of the teacher both is impacted and impacts how children are served in the school

## Key terms in the chapter are…

- Diversity
- Multiculturalism
- Socioeconomic status
- IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Act)
- Child abuse
- Bullying

In  order  for  us  to  feel  confident  and  secure  in  taking  risks,  we have to feel safe. We have to be both physically and psychologically safe.  Our  students  have  to  be  relatively  sure  that  their  physical being is  not  in  danger.  Equally  important  is  being  psychologically safe.  Students  have  to  feel  they  will  not  be  laughed  at,  made  fun of,  ridiculed,  or  humiliated  for  their  learning  endeavors.  Do  you remember  teachers  who  used  some  of  these  techniques  in  their teaching or allowed classmates to engage in these behaviors? If you

look at Maslow's 'Hierarchy of Needs,' you will see that safety needs are the next level above basic food and shelter.

![Image](output_md\Introduction-to-Education-1701296386_artifacts\image_000019_c242e5f4b2c0e1d36081557f387016d00cc42dc8edb2b97ecabf26b9489f4c36.png)

Educators play an important role  in  helping  students  feel safe.  If a student does not feel psychologically safe, he/she may stop engaging in class because  it  is   'safer'  that  way, especially if it is a student who struggles with academic endeavors. When this happens, learning fails to take place.

A major factor in feeling safe, and being willing to take risks lies in the relationship between teacher and student.  Teachers have to work to develop a respectful, trusting relationship with students. The  lack  of  this  relationship  is  the  cause  of  many  difficulties  in the classroom between teacher and student, as well as the lack of motivation and willingness to take learning risks.    Part of treating students  respectfully  is  listening  to  their  ideas,  concerns,  and thoughts and being willing to compromise with them.

## Students are Different

Students  are  different.   They  each  come  with  special  academic, social,  cultural,  and  emotional  needs.   This  section  will  highlight some  differences  found  in  classrooms  today  and  how  educators help connect with their students.

## Academic Needs

While human growth and development follow predictable patterns and stages, every human goes through the stages at a different rate. A teacher may be teaching a room full of eighth-graders who are

at various levels of development. This is particularly challenging for teachers in the elementary years. It is not uncommon to teach in a classroom with four or five different reading levels. It is only with this  knowledge  that  teachers  can  truly  understand  students  and provide the best possible learning environment for them.

Our  current  knowledge  of  a  subject  forms  the  base  for  future learning. Educators take students where they are at and build on their current knowledge. This perspective will change what educators  do  with  students  and  it  will  make  a  difference  in  how the  student  perceives  themselves.  If  they  have  a  more  positive perception of their skills and abilities, you will find they are more willing  to  take  risks.   For  example,  if  an  educator  tells  a  student, 'Your  paragraphing  skills  are  poor  and  we  need  to  work  on improving them',  the  conversation  starts  with  a  negative  and  the student feels inadequate and this impacts self-esteem, and confidence,  as  well  as  motivation.   However,  if  educators  tell  the same student, 'Your writing contains new insights and ideas that are not often considered by others.  One way we can improve on the understanding of those ideas, however, is to work on improving your paragraphing skills.  We can work on that together.'  Educators set a more positive tone and greater confidence in the student.  Try

not to get into the mindset of trying to 'fix' what's not working and work from the idea of 'This is where the student is strong, and this is where I want to take them.'  It will make a big difference in the student's willingness to work hard, and in their success.

## Areas of Diversity

While our students will be at different levels of learning, they will have different learning needs and possess a variety of learning styles as well. They will also differ in many other ways. A few of these are:

- Gender
- Family Structure
- Family's beliefs on education
- How family values education
- Socioeconomic Status
- Culture
- Language
- Background Knowledge/Experience
- Religion
- Students receiving Special Education Services
- Students who are working above grade level in one or more area

Classrooms  are  diverse  in  many  ways,  but  one  thing  is  almost certain,  you  will  have  students  in  your  class  who  are  receiving special education services. Prior to 1975, special education students were segregated into their own classrooms, or not even included in  our  neighborhood  schools.  In  1975,  Public  Law  94-142  created provisions for special needs students to be included in our schools. In  1990,  it  was  amended  and  renamed  the  'Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act.' (IDEA) The law mandates that services

be provided for students.  Review the information on IDEA in the chapter, 'School Laws and Organization'.

Teachers may also have students in your classroom who are  working  above  grade  level in  one  subject  area  or  more. Some, but not all, may be identified as gifted and/or talented by their school. When you  have  children  you  know need  an  additional  challenge, work with parents and other professionals to provide the necessary experiences for them.

## Family: A Partner in Education

One  of  the  biggest  influences  on  a  student  is  the  family.  There are  a  wide  variety  of  family  structures  in  our  society  today.  The current  state  of  our  economy  has  placed  a  financial  burden  on many families. The structure of a family, the expectations they have for  their  children,  the  economic  and  social  climate  that  they  live under and the overall well-being of the family will influence a child's performance  in  school.  It  is  our  responsibility  to  be  aware  of situations and help students work and deal with them, not ridicule or  punish  because  of  circumstances.  We  have  to  respect  families for  what  they  are,  accept  and  tolerate  their  ideas,  values,  and circumstances even if we don't agree. Here is another place where we have to push our biases and prejudices aside and look at what's best for the student. For example, a child goes to daycare every day after school and in the evening he/she is cared for by grandparents because one or more parents work. We would want to look closely at  any  homework  we  might  consider  sending  home.  Chances  are this child is not going to have the opportunity, or the support, to

get it done. Sending it anyway sets the student up for failure from the start. We might have to modify our practices to accommodate this child. Being a teacher is not easy! If you think it is, I suggest you  look  for  another  career.  I  don't  want  you  to  be  disappointed later. In order to do the best for our students, we often have to go the extra mile, change many of our practices, and look for ways to accommodate students and their situations.

## Who are today's students?

To  address  the  opening  question,  'Why  do  teachers  teach?',  the answer  is  simple;  'They  teach  for  the  love  of  children  and  to contribute to the well-being of all of us' (Teachers are Important, 1998, para. 4).  It is something inside them. It is a drive, a force, a passion, a talent that motivates to teach his or her students in order to  watch  them  succeed.   Choosing  to  be  a  teacher  is  not  for  the money, as a teacher's monetary compensation is hardly adequate given  all  that  they  give  to  their  students.   Becoming  a  teacher  is almost  like  heeding  a  calling.   It  is  not  for  the  light  at  heart,  but rather, for those who love children and people, who have a passion for education, and who love to share in that passion.

In a recent population survey, 7.1  million  students  under  the age of 18 lived in a neighborhood  with  a  poverty rate of 30 percent or more. This high incidence of poverty places these children at a higher rate of becoming ill, not having proper health care, becoming parents before finishing school, using illegal drugs, being exposed to or involved in violence, and going to jail before they are even old enough to vote. These  social  issues,  which  will  be  discussed  in  this  chapter,  can impact a child's life both outside school as well as inside school.  In education, there is a responsibility to teach them all, but are there things that teachers should know to do this well?  Children living in below-average neighborhoods should be given the same opportunities  as  children  living  in  average  and  above-average housing.

Learning Objectives

## In this chapter, readers will…

- Identify critical social issues that directly influence the students' academic success in the classroom
- Describe the impact poverty has on a student's potential for success in schools
- Define the role of communication between the school and family

## Key terms in the chapter are…

- Socioeconomic status
- At-risk
- Poverty

## The Challenges of Poverty

A major disadvantage to students produced from living in povertystricken neighborhoods is the possibility of growing up not being able to succeed in life because they were not properly trained as children. It is the responsibility of the authoritarians, policymakers, parents, schools, and teachers to make sure each student, despite their living arrangements, is given an equal opportunity to succeed. Statistics have shown that students who live in poor neighborhoods usually test lower on standardized tests. The students also tend to learn less than students in average schools.

To make sure students living in low-income neighborhoods are well  prepared  for  life  as  adults,  certain  things  are  required.  Basic aspects  include  greater  access  to  support  that  all  families  need to  raise  kids  successfully-employment  opportunities  for  parents, quality  health  care,  formal  and  informal  networks  of  adults  who

can assist in times of crisis, vibrant religious institutions, organized recreation,  and  safe  streets.  Parental  opportunities,  good  health care, religious groups, and fun activities all make for a well-rounded student,  but  these  children  need  a  quality  education.  Education has been the vehicle for advancing the social and economic status of children and families, compensating for poverty and distressed environments, and, for millions of kids, paving the way to opportunities unavailable to their parents. Education is the catalyst for success. Research shows that school completion and academic success  increase  children's  ability  to  escape  poverty,  form  strong families, and raise successful kids of their own. Research from the U.S.  Bureau  of  the  Census,  Money  Income  in  the  United  States, states that a college graduate earns twice as much money a year compared  to  an  adult  with  only  a  high  school  diploma,  and  that same college graduate earns about three times as much as a high school dropout. Sadly, students living in these low-income neighborhoods are falling by the wayside. The chances of getting a quality education while living in poverty are very small. If our nation is to remain prosperous and committed to equality of opportunity, we must create successful schools for poor children.

## Contributing to Successful Students

Students in poverty-stricken neighborhoods  can  succeed. To contribute to kids' success in school and overall development, five ideas should be demonstrated. They include:

1. Preschool experiences that prepare children to learn,
2. Schools that are small enough to engage every child,
3. High standards in curriculum, instruction, and assessment,
4. Strong, meaningful family participation, and
5. Making education part of a larger community committed to healthy youth and family development.

High-quality  early  childhood  care  and  preschool  education  can stimulate  cognitive  development,  increase  school  readiness,  and advance  academic  achievement  in  the  early  elementary  grades. Smaller  classroom  sizes  promote  more  one  on  one  between  the student and teacher. Students can receive more individualized help. The teachers are also able to change the flow of instructional time if necessary; they can do what works best for the class as a whole. Higher success rates also come  from  having 'high learning standards,  challenging  curricula  based  on  those  standards,  and instructional practices that keep kids actively engaged in learning. In  schools,  standards  are  set  so  the  students  comprehend  the seriousness and the value the school places on academic success. States like  Kentucky, Washington, and Maryland and districts like Milwaukee  and  Philadelphia  have  taken  significant  steps  to  set standards that are aligned with curriculum, instruction, and assessment  practices.   Parental  involvement  and  parent-teacher interaction are also key to the success of the students. Interaction between the teacher and parent can be as simple as a brief email or telephone call. Involvement should include knowing the latest news in the school, participating in any parent orientations and meetings, and helping and being aware of the students' homework.

## Other Social Issues That May Affect Education

## Homelessness

A  child's  success  may  be  dependent  upon  many  factors  that  may take place in the home or the lack thereof. According to the Year 2005 Report to Congress on the Education for Homeless Children and  Youth  Program,  there  were  approximately  928,429  homeless children and youth (Pre K-12) reported in 2000, an increase of 10 percent over the last reporting year of 1997, with 65 percent of these children in Pre K-Grade 6. Students who are homeless are defined as lacking a stable, long-term place to reside. The students may be:

- Sharing the housing of other persons due to the loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar reason,
- Living in motels, hotels, trailer parks, or camping grounds due to the lack of alternative adequate accommodations,
- Living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, bus or train stations, or similar settings,
- Living in emergency or transitional shelters,
- Abandoned in hospitals,

- Awaiting foster care placement,
- Have a primary nighttime residence that is not designed for regular sleeping accommodation for humans.

Homeless  students  are  battered  psychologically  and  emotionally and have added pressures once entering the school building. These children are presented with many obstacles to overcome in school ranging from having their homes taken away, living in a shelter, to not  knowing  when  and  where  their  next  meal  is  going  to  come. Once  in  the  classroom,  the  students  have  a  hard  time  focusing, forcing  them  to  become  less  motivated  about  completing  school. Homeless  students  have  a  higher  rate  of  dropping  out  of  school entering the workforce because of a lack of enthusiasm and focus. Those students who chose to be homeless, because they have run away from home, experience both sexual and physical abuse. They sometimes become involved with illegal drugs and excessive alcohol use. Other factors that may be a factor that might prohibit a quality education for a homeless child may  include poor nutrition, inadequate sleep, and lack of health care.

## Family Composition

An interview with a social worker revealed the impact of home and social  environment  on  a  child's  education.  In  this  social  worker's school,  a  school  for  children  with  emotional  and/or  learning disabilities, a number of the students resides in neighborhoods at or below poverty level. They are oftentimes being raised by single parents  or  grandparents  who  also  care  for  other  children  or relatives placing the child's education low on the caregiver's list of priorities. Children from these types of environments often display inappropriate  behavior  that  negatively  impacts  their  academic development.

A  major  difficulty  for  the  teachers  and  social  workers  in  this

school is the lack of parental involvement. The school, according to the social worker, is at least an hour-long bus ride for the parents (most don't own cars) which keeps many parents from visiting the school  and  meeting  the  child's  teachers.  The  school  has  often offered to fund the parents' transportation to and from the school; however, the parents face difficulties in getting time off from their jobs.  Whether  or  not  the  parents'  have  an  interest  in  the  child's education,  the  children  do  not  see  a  connection  between  the parents and their teachers resulting in a lack of academic motivation and no desire to behave appropriately.

An article in The Elementary School Journal entitled 'Teachers' Reported Practices of Parent Involvement: Problems and Possibilities,'  by  Joyce  L.  Epstein  and  Henry  Jay  Becker  of  Johns Hopkins  University  which  addresses  the  family  and  how  parental involvement  affects  a  child's  educational  process.  This  article  is about  a  study  of  teachers  in  Maryland  and  how  they  feel  about parent  involvement.  The  comments  from  the  3,700  teachers  vary tremendously from teachers who strongly believe that their job can only be performed adequately if they can rely on parental help, and the other opposite thought from teachers who have long given up the  hope  of  parental  help.  Some  of  the  teachers  polled  felt  that 'parents  have  so  little  prime  time  to  spend  with  their  child  or children,' (Epstein, 1982) that it is very hard to cultivate a parentteacher relationship much less a parent-teacher-child relationship.

This study/article also delves into the world of today, and how the working parents have more demands on their time and how helping kids at home becomes a more frustrating task when a parent is tired or  has  so  many  jobs  to  just  pay  the  bills  (Epstein,  1982).  Teachers seem to be split down the middle when it comes to deciding if it is worth their effort to try to involve parents, but the general synopsis of the study was that in the long run, it is well worth the effort for the child's sake no matter what the family structure entails. Single parents, working parents, grandparents raising their grandchildren, and all family structures should begin with the child's educational process at home and help the schools and teachers open the doors

and  windows  into  the  mind  of  the  child.  This  applies  to  every socioeconomic structure of the family, not just poverty structures.

## Drugs, Alcohol, and Abuse

Drugs and alcohol can have a lasting effect on children. The effects can start in fetal development and continue through life development.  Having  a  mother  who  uses  alcohol  or  drugs  while pregnant  can  affect  the  fetus  and  have  lasting  effects  on  their cognitive and social development. Alcohol can cause mental retardation,  slower  physical  development,  severe  learning,  and cognitive disabilities. A mother that uses illegal drugs, like marijuana, cocaine, etc, can also have a severe and lasting effect on the child. They can decrease the cellular oxygen and nutrient supply for the fetus which then affects the parts of the brain responsible for learning, memory, behavior, and cognitive functions. It can also cause language delays and attention problems. (Kaplan, 122)

Drugs and alcohol can also affect more than just the child's body, it also affects the environment they live in. Drug and alcohol abuse leads to poverty, abuse, and neglect in the home. The parents are too busy with their habits that they have little emotional involvement with the child. (Kaplan, 124-125).

Abuse is also a major problem affecting children in school and life. Out of the three million children that are reported each year to child protective service agencies for being alleged victims of abuse and neglect, about one-third (about one million) are determined to be legitimate cases that require action (Bullough, 69). There are three types of abuse; physical, sexual, and emotional. Physical neglect is the most common form of child maltreatment. It is responsible for about sixty percent (60%) of all reported cases of abuse (Bullough, 57). They all have major lasting effects on the children. All of them cause psychological problems  in the child.  Abuse  can  cause language delays, poor social relationships with peers, lower

intelligence scores, and behavioral problems. Studies show that the abused  child  also  is  more  likely  to  experience  failure  in  school because of all the problems abuse causes. (Kaplan, 355) At least half of  all  valid  child  abuse  cases  involve  caregivers  under  alcohol  or drug abuse (Bullough, 43).

## How can families and schools better communicate?

Although  the  research  and  statistics  about  the  impact  of  social issues  on  a  child's  education  can  be  overwhelming,  the  role  of communication  can  help.  It  is  hard  to  believe  that  we  have  a breakdown in communication on any level in today's world. We have the ability to be connected 24 hours a day seven days a week. Cell phones, pagers, and the Internet are all devices we use daily to stay connected, so it is not surprising that the communications between the families and the schools the children attend are in sync more than ever. There is a real effort to include families into the school environment, and in some ways, the programs the schools have for our children could not take place without the effort of the parents and guardians. Communication with our children's teachers is right at our fingertips, but without getting the information out to parents on how to access this information, it is a resource that is wasted.

## Staying in Touch

When parents are involved in their children's

education, studies show that students generally have higher grades and test scores, and are more likely to go to college.

-Parent-Teachers Association (www.pta.org)

It is important for those parents who may not be able to take time out of their busy lives to volunteer within the school to be able to communicate with the teachers and have information on what is going on in their children's lives as well. This has become extremely easy  with  the  introduction  of  technology  into  our  everyday  lives. Parents  can  email  directly  to  their  child's  teacher  any  time  day or night, schools have a direct voice mailbox for parents to leave messages for the teacher, and the use of cell phones for immediate contact. No longer do we have to hear about a situation after the fact,  but  we  now  have  the  ability  to  know  immediately.  As  your child becomes older, they are less likely to bring home the everyday paper that has been graded. The days of parents unaware of their child's  progress  until  report  cards  are  in  the  past.  Now,  parents can access their child's grades using the Internet. Parents can see what is going on within the school on Internet-based School Web Sites and even have homework and daily announcements sent right to  their  home  computers  or  hand-held  devices.  Staying  in  touch with your children's teacher and school has never been as easy or more accessible. Technology is not the only answer to keeping the communication  lines  only,  School  Systems  across  the  nation  are setting days on their yearly calendars for personal conferences.

One school system in Virginia Beach has devoted several days of  teacher-parent  conferences staggered throughout the year. This  is  where  the  teacher  and parent can meet during the day, at  a  time  convenient  for  both parties.  The  meeting  is  spent discussing the progress the child is making. They can talk of strategies and the teachers can give parents advice on what they need to work on at home to assist the student in making sure they stay up to date with their studies. This allows the parents to meet the teacher and put a face and personality with a name. The teacher in return can speak directly to the parent and form a relationship. It gives the link needed to help the child succeed, as one principal of a school said, 'To run an effective school, there has to be that link between the home and the school. If you don't have that link, you're spinning your wheels. You never make a dent in education unless the parents are involved.' (2007, The Record) Gone are the days of putting  your  child  on  the  bus  and  seeing  them  when  they  arrive home at the end of the day. Today's schools encourage parents to become familiar faces inside the school.

One problem however is the fact that not all parents have access to email or cell phones, and a lot of single parents work hours that make  it  almost  impossible  to  come  in  for  a  conference  unless  it is  planned  well  in  advance.  One  way  to  overcome  this  is  through SchoolCall .  This  system  makes  it  simple  for  schools  to  report student  absences  to  parents  automatically,  set  up  web  interfaces that  allow  teachers  to  set  up  call  groups,  and  even  voicemail  for faculty. This system should be taken a step further to allow calls to a teacher's room to be forwarded to their home. This would allow parents who can't call during school hours to contact the teacher without  the  teacher's  home  phone  number.  Often  these  are  the ones, single parents working crazy hours who need to be able to get

in contact with teachers and can't always rely on the child to bring messages home, who need this access. While email and cell phones are great, they don't work for everyone and we as teachers need to be aware of this and find ways around this problem.

## Getting Involved

Statistics show that there is a 'positive and convincing relationship between  family  involvement  and  benefits  for  students,  including improved academic achievement.' (Henderson &amp; Mapp 2002). When it  has been shown to improve test scores with increased parental involvement schools, school boards and states have come up with ways to make sure that the parents have an opportunity to play a role in their child's education. It is no longer just the teacher's job to  make sure your child is learning. We are now in an age where the parent's role has become increasingly important in the type of education your child is receiving.

Several major groups play a large part in bridging the communication gap between parents and their children's schools. The PTA has become a powerhouse for all individual schools over the past several years. The PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) is an organization on the front line of any school when it comes to parent participation.  It  organizes  volunteers  who  are  responsible  for  inschool  and  after-school  programs  that  have  branched  out  from carnivals and field days to educational programs such as math and science  night.  In  December  2003,  a  campaign  was  designed  to 'increase awareness of critical benefits of parental involvement and to provide parents with practical, easy ways to help their children succeed in school and life.'  (pta.org)  This  advertising  campaign  is a  tool  that  is  used  to  inform  parents  that  it  is  vital  to  becoming involved  in  their  children's  education.  Directed  by  actor  James Woods,  the  ad  states  that  you  must  'Know  what  really  matters, know about your kid's school, and know about your kid' (pta.org)

it follows with a phone number and website that you could use to find your schools information on its PTA organization. One example of  how  far  the  PTA  has  come  over  the  years  is  the  Reflections Contest held every year. The Reflections Contest is run by local PTA volunteers within each school, which bring together teachers and parents to entice students to enter into a contest displaying their talents in many categories such as music, art, poetry, and drama. Winners are judged and chosen on a local, state, and then national level, and each year the students can compete to come up with the theme for the following year. This is a great way families can become involved, work with and begin the process of communicating with the teachers and the school.

Another organization is the School Planning Council. This is made up of Administration, Teachers, and Parents who meet together at the beginning of every school year to go over the curriculum. This is a very important organization that allows parents to have a voice in what their child is learning. The opportunity to participate in the Council is offered to every parent of the school their child attends. This is another bridge to enable parents to become involved with their children's education.

## Open Door Policy

Today's  school  has  a  variety  of  volunteer  positions  that  enable parents to become a part of the school day. This has come into play on a major scale with the 'No Child Left Behind Act of 2001' (NCLB) Title  I  of  NCLB  (Section  1118)  'outline  requirements  for  schools, districts,  and  cites  to  create  partnerships  between  parents  and schools. Under NCLB, schools were required to provide opportunities  for  parent  involvement'  (Vaden-Kiernan,  2002-03) Teachers asked parents to come into the class and volunteer, they encouraged  parents  to  come  in  and  help  with  all  of  the  day  to day activities and schools have begun opening their doors. Parents

can come into the class and help out with tasks that take up the teacher's  instruction  time.  For  example,  parents  can  help  the teacher  with  copying  papers,  filing,  and  grading  so  that  the instructional  time  for  teachers  will  not  be  cut  short  with  nonteaching tasks and enables the teacher to concentrate on teaching. Principals  play  a  vital  role  in  allowing  open  door  policies  within the schools so that parent involvement can happen. Principals give the face to the school as a friendly family environment. If a parent feels wanted, it is more likely that they will want to return to that environment.  And  studies  showed  that  it  is  possible  that  'higher parent  involvement  encourages  schools  to  communicate  better with parents.' (Vaden-Kiernan, 2002-03)

## Conclusion

A child's destiny should not be determined by the neighborhood a child  lives  in,  the  composition  of  the  child's  family,  or  the  child's circumstances. Every child should be given the same  equal opportunity to achieve excellence. Teachers should view every child as a child that is capable of learning. The responsibility of instilling the  value  of  learning  is  placed  not  only  on  the  parents,  but  the teachers,  administrators,  school  board  officials,  and  every  other adult that has a part in a child's life.

Communication is  key  when  meeting  the  needs  of  all  learners. Today's  school  systems  are  finding  a  variety  of  ways  to  improve communication  between  parents  and  their  schools.  Schools  are improving parental information of how their child develops. Schools are giving information about the developmental processes and the expectations  of  the  child,  according  to  grade  level,  through  the literature  available  to  all  parents.  Schools  are  keeping  lines  of communication open. They are making teachers available and more accessible  along  with  incorporating  technology,  which  enables easier  access  for  parents  to  communicate  with  their  schools  and

encouraging  parent  involvement  with  an  abundance  of  programs for  parents  to  become  involved.  Every  child  benefits  when  there is  an established and comfortable line of communication between parents and the school.

What makes a teacher? Teaching  is  like  a  salad.  Think about it. If you were to attend a party for any given holiday, the number  of  and  variations  to each salad recipe that might be present for consumption could outnumber those present at the party. There are so many different ways to teach, varying circumstances to take into account, and philosophies to apply to each classroom. And what better way to have a positive impact on the world than to offer knowledge for consumption?  The  term  'teacher'  can  be  applied  to  anyone  who imparts knowledge of any topic, but it is generally more focused on those  who  are  hired  to  do  so  (teach,  n.d.,  n.p.).  In  imparting knowledge to our students, it is inevitable that we must take into account our own personal philosophies or pedagogies, and determine not only how we decide what our philosophies are, but also how those impact our consumers.

## Objectives and Key Terms

## In this chapter, readers will…

- Define, describe, and identify the four branches of educational philosophy
- Outline at least two educational philosophies that influence our schools
- Explain how educational philosophies influence the choice of curriculum and classroom instructional practices
- Develop a personal philosophy concerning teaching and learning

## Key terms in the chapter are…

- Philosophy
- Pedagogy
- Constructivism
- Perennialism
- Essentialism
- Progressivism
- Romanticism
- Behaviorism

## Lessons in Pedagogy

What,  exactly,  are  education  philosophies?  According  to  Thelma Roberson (2000),  most  prospective  teachers  confuse  their  beliefs with the ideas of teaching (p. 6). Education philosophies, then, are not  what  you  want  to  do  in  class  to  aid  learning,  but  why  you do  them  and  how  they  work.  For  example,  Roberson's  students state  they  'want  to  use  cooperative  learning  techniques'  in  their classroom. The question posed is, why? '[I]s cooperative learning a true philosophy or is it something you do in the classroom because of  your  belief  about  the  way  children  learn?'  (Roberson,  2000,  p. 6). Philosophies need to translate ideas into action - if you want to use certain techniques, then you need to understand how they are effective in the classroom to create that portion of your education philosophy. It helps to have an overview of the various schools out there.

- Perennialism - focuses on human concerns that have caused concern for centuries, revealed through 'great works' (Ornstein, 2003, p. 110)  It focuses on great works of art, literature and enduring ideas.
- Essentialism - Emphasizes skills and subjects that are needed by all in a productive society. This is the belief in 'Back to Basics'.  Rote learning is emphasized and
- Progressivism - Instruction features problem-solving and group activities - The instructor acts as a facilitator as opposed to a leader (Ornstein, 2003, p. 110)
- Social Reconstructionism - Instruction that focuses on significant social and economic problems in an effort to solve them (Ornstein, 2003, pg.110)
- Existentialism - Classroom dialogue stimulates awareness each person creates an awareness gleaned from discussion and encourages deep personal reflection on his or her convictions (Ornstein, 2003, p. 108).

## Perennialism

- The knowledge that has been passed through the ages should be continued as the basis of the curriculum, like the classic works of Plato and Einstein.
- Reason, logic, and analytical thought are valued and encouraged
- Only information that stood the test of time is relevant.  It is believed these prepare students for life and help to develop rational thinking.
- The classes most likely to be considered under this approach would be history, science, math, and religion classes (Educational Philosophies in the Classroom, pg.1).

## Essentialism

- Essentialists believe that there is a universal pool of knowledge needed by all students.
- The fundamentals of teaching are the basis of the curriculum: math, science, history, foreign language, and English. Vocational classes are not seen as a necessary part of educational training.
- Classrooms are formal, teacher-centered, and students are passive learners.
- Evaluations are predominately through testing, and there are few, if any, projects or portfolios.

## Progressivism

- This is a student-centered form of instruction where students follow the scientific method of questioning and searching for the answer.
- Evaluations include projects and portfolios.
- Current events are used to keep students interested in the required subject matter.
- Students are active learners as opposed to passive learners.
- The teacher is a facilitator rather than the center of the educational process.
- Student input is encouraged, and students are asked to find their interpretation of the answer, have a choice in projects and assignments. (Educational Philosophies in the classroom, pg.1).
- Real-world problem solving emphasized.
- Subjects are integrated.
- Interaction among students.
- Students have a voice in the classroom.

## Social Reconstructivism

- This student-centered philosophy strives to instill a desire to make the world a better place.

- It places a focus on controversial world issues and uses current events as a springboard for the thinking process.
- These students are taught the importance of working together to bring about change.
- These teachers incorporate what is happening in the world with what they are learning in the classroom (Educational Philosophies in the Classroom, pg.1).

## Additional Beliefs in Regards to Teaching/ Learning

## Constructivism

Active participation is the key to this teaching style. Students are free to explore their own ideas and share concepts with one another in nontraditional ways. 'Hands-on activity […] is the most effective way  of  learning  and  is  considered  true  learning'  (Educational Philosophies in the Classroom, pg.1).

## What is Constructivism?

The root word of Constructivism is 'construct.' Basically, Constructivism is the theory that knowledge must be constructed by a person, not just transmitted to the person. People construct knowledge by taking new information and integrating it with their own  pre-existing  knowledge  (Cooper,  2007;  Woolfolk,  2007).  It means  they  are  actively  involved  in  seeking  out  information, creating projects, and working with material being presented versus just sitting and listening to someone 'talk at them'.

## Jean Piaget's Theory of Constructivism

Jean  Piaget  was  one  of  the  major  constructivists  in  past  history. His theory looks at how people construct knowledge cognitively. In Piaget's theory, everybody has schemata.  These are the categories of information we create to organize the information we take in.  For example, 'food' is one schema we may have.  We have a variety of information on food. It can be organized into different food groups

such as the following: bread/pasta, fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy, and sweets (Kail &amp; Cavanaugh, 2007).  We use these schemas to help us 'make sense' of what we see, hear and experience, and integrate this information into our knowledge bank.

According to Piaget's theory, one way people construct knowledge  is  through  assimilation.  People  assimilate  when  they incorporate  new  knowledge  and  information  into  pre-existing schemes. Here is an example: A child sees a car and learns that it can be called a vehicle. Then the child sees a motorcycle and learns that it can be called a vehicle as well. Then the child sees a truck and calls it  a  vehicle.  Basically,  the  child  developed  a  schema  for  'vehicles' and incorporated trucks into that schema (Kail &amp; Cavanaugh, 2007).

Another way people construct knowledge, according to Piaget's theory, is through accommodation. People accommodate when they modify or change their pre-existing schemes. Here is an example.: A  child  sees  a  dog  (a  furry  four-legged  animal)  and  learns  that  it can be called a pet. Then the child sees a cat (a furry four-legged animal)  and  learns  that  it  can  be  called  a  pet  as  well.  Then  the child  sees  a  raccoon  (also  a  furry  four-legged  animal)  and  calls it  a  pet.  Afterward,  the  child  learns  from  his  or  her  parents  that a  raccoon  is  not  a  pet.  At  first,  the  child  develops  a  schema  for 'pet' which includes all furry four-legged animals. Then the child learns  that  not  all  furry  four-legged  animals  are  pets.  Because  of this, the child needs to accommodate his or her schema for 'pet.' According to Piaget, people learn through a balance of assimilation and accommodation (Kail &amp; Cavanaugh, 2007).

## Lev Vygotsky's Theory of Constructivism

Lev Vygotsky was another major constructivist in past history. While Jean Piaget's theory is a cognitive perspective, Vygotsky's theory is a sociocultural perspective. His theory looks at how people construct knowledge  by  collaborating  with  others.  In  Vygotsky's  theory,

people learn and construct knowledge within the Zone of Proximal Development.  People  have  an  independent  level  of  performance where they can do things independently. Likewise, people have a frustration level where tasks are too difficult to be able to perform on  their  own.   In  between,  there  is  an  instructional  level  where they can do things above the independent level with the help and guidance of others. The range, or zone, between the independent and frustration levels is the Zone of Proximal Development (Cooper, 2007; Kail &amp; Cavanaugh, 2007; Woolfolk, 2007).

'What a child can do today with assistance, she will be able to do by herself tomorrow.' -Lev S. Vygotsky

In the Zone of Proximal Development, assistance needs to be given by another person. This assistance, help, or guidance is known as scaffolding. Because the zone has a range, assistance needs to be given, but not too much. If not enough assistance is given, a person may not be able to learn the task. On the other hand, if too much assistance is given, the person may not be able to fully construct the newly  acquired  information  into  knowledge.  For  example,  a  child needs help doing math homework. With no help, the child may not be able to do it. With too much help, the homework is done for the child,  so  the  child  may  not  fully  understand  the  math  homework anyway (Cooper, 2007; Kail &amp; Cavanaugh, 2007; Woolfolk, 2007).

## Constructivism in the Classroom

In the classroom, the teacher can use Constructivism to help teach the students. The teacher can base the instruction on the cognitive strategies,  experiences,  and  culture  of  the  students.  The  teacher

can  make  the  instruction  interesting  by  correlating  it  with  reallife  applications,  especially  applications  within  the  students'  own communities. Students can work and collaborate together during particular  activities.  The  teacher  can  provide  feedback  for  the students so they know what they can do independently and know what  they  need  help  with.  New  concepts  can  be  related  to  the students' prior knowledge. The teacher can also explain how new concepts can be used in different contexts and subjects. All these ideas are based on Constructivism (Sherman &amp; Kurshan, 2005).

Research  shows  that  constructivist  teaching  can  be  effective. According  to  research  conducted  by  Jong  Suk  Kim  at  Chungnum National University in Korea, constructivist teaching is  more effective  than  traditional  teaching  when  looking  at  the  students' academic achievement. The research also shows that students have some  preference  for  constructivist  teaching  (Kim,  2005).  Again, when  the  theory  of  Constructivism  is  actually  applied  in  the classroom, it can be effective for teaching students.

It  is  not  the  sole  responsibility  of  the  teachers  to  educate  the students. According to Constructivism, students have some responsibilities when learning. A student may be quick to blame the teacher for not understanding the material, but it could be the case that the student is not doing everything he or she could be doing. Because knowledge is constructed, not transmitted, students need to make an effort to assimilate, accommodate, and make sense of information. They also need to make an effort to collaborate with others, especially if they are having a hard time understanding the information.

## Four Philosophies in Assessment

In addition, the 'constructivist' school of philosophy, rooted in the Pragmatic pedagogy and branched off from the 'Social Reconstructivist'  school,  has  gained  much  popularity.  Around  the turn of the century (the early 1990s), many teachers felt the rote

memorization and mindless routine that was common  was ineffective  and  began  to  look  for  alternate  ways  to  reach  their students (Ornstein, 2003, p. 111). Through the constructivist approach, 'students 'construct' knowledge through an interaction between  what  they  already  think  and  know  and  with  new  ideas and experiences' (Roberson, 2000, p. 8). This is an active learning process  that  leads  to  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  concepts presented in class and is based on the abilities and readiness of the children rather than set curriculum guidelines (Ornstein, 2003, p. 112).  Constructivism  'emphasizes socially  interactive  and  processoriented 'hands-on' learning in which students work collaboratively to expand and revise their knowledge base' (Ornstein, 2003, p. 112). Essentially, the knowledge that is shaped by experience is reconstructed  or  altered,  to  assist  the  student  in  understanding new concepts (Ornstein, 2003, p. 112). You, as the teacher, help the students build the scaffolding they need to maintain the information even after the test is taken and graded.

## Creating Your Philosophy

Educators  continue  to  build  upon  their  philosophy  over  their careers. They often choose elements from various philosophies and integrate them into their own.  When identifying a philosophy, here are things to consider:

- What is the purpose of education?
- What do you believe should be taught?
- How do you think the curriculum should be taught?
- What is your role as the teacher?
- What is the role of the student?
- What is the value of teacher-centered instruction and studentcentered instruction; where and when do you incorporate each?

## 6. Excellence or Equity... Which is More Important?

JENNIFER BEASLEY AND MYRA HAULMARK

In the United States, the start of the twentieth century marked  a  movement  towards the  inclusion  of  more  people than  ever  into  the  educational system.  In  1900,  close  to  six percent of teenagers graduated from high school. States attempted to increase that

number by making that goal more accessible through the construction of more high schools in both urban and rural localities (Wolfe,  2001).  Laws  were  passed  that  made  school  mandatory  for children  until  elementary  school;  later,  it  became  obligatory  until they became sixteen years old. However, a good and equal education was not yet widely available to all Americans. Marginalized groups hovered at the fringes of the educational system. African-Americans received  unequal  and  inferior  educations  as  compared  to  that  of whites,  as  did  other  minorities  and  students  with  limited  English proficiency  (LEP).  Women  were  discriminated  against  and  the handicapped  in  being  fully  included  in  the  educational  system. Major  developments  in  the  twentieth-century  education  system include  various  rulings  and  acts  that  promoted  a  fair  and  equal education for Americans that had been neglected and marginalized. In this chapter, we will explore some of the obstacles facing equity in education.

## Equity and Equality

Educational  equity also  referred  to  as  ' Equity  in  education , '  is  a measure  of  achievement,  fairness,  and  opportunity  in  education. The  study  of  education  equity  is  often  linked  with  the  study  of excellence and equity.

Educational  equity  depends  on  two  main  factors.  The  first  is fairness,  which  implies  that  factors  specific  to  one's  conditions

should  not  interfere  with  the  potential  of  academic  success.  The second important factor is inclusion, which refers to a comprehensive  standard  that  applies  to  everyone  in  a  certain education system. These two factors are closely related and depend on each other for an educational system's success.

The  growing  importance  of  education  equity  is  based  on  the premise  that  an  individual's  level  of  education  directly  correlates to  the  future  quality  of  life.  Therefore,  an  academic  system  that practices educational equity is a strong foundation of a society that is fair and thriving. However, inequity in education is challenging to avoid and can be broken down into inequity due to socioeconomic standing, race, gender, or disability. Educational equity is also based on  the  historical  context  of  the  location,  people,  and  structure. History  shapes  the  outcome  of  individuals  within  the  education system.

Often, the terms 'equity' and 'equality' are interchanged when referring  to  educational  equity.  Although  similar,  there  can  be important distinctions between the two.

## Equity

Equity recognizes that some are at a larger disadvantage than others and  aims  at  compensating  for  these  people's  misfortunes  and disabilities  to  ensure  that  everyone  can  attain  the  same  type  of healthy lifestyle.] Examples of this are when libraries offer literacy programs  when  schools  offer  courses  in  English  as  a  second language,  and  when  foundations  target  scholarships  to  students from  poor  families,  they  operationalize  a  belief  in  the  equity  of access  as  fairness  and  as  justice.   Equity  recognizes  this  uneven playing field and aims to take extra measures by giving those who are in need more than others who are not. Equity aims at making sure that everyone's lifestyle is equal even if it may come at the cost

of unequal distribution of access and goods. Social justice leaders in education strive to ensure equitable outcomes for their students.

## Equality

The  American  Library  Association  defines  equality  as:  'access  to channels of communication and sources of information that is made available on even terms to all-a level playing field-is derived from the  concept  of  fairness  as  uniform  distribution,  where  everyone is  entitled  to  the  same  level  of  access  and  can  avail  themselves  if they so choose.' (ALA). In this definition of equality, no one person has an unfair advantage. Everyone is given equal opportunities and accessibility  and  is  then  free  to  do  what  they  please  with  it. However, this is not to say that everyone is then inherently equal. Some people may choose to seize these open and equal opportunities while others let them pass by.

## Tracking and Equity

Tracking  systems,  are  selective  measures  to  locate  students  in different  educational  levels.  They  are  created  to  increase  the efficiency of education.  It allows making more or less homogeneous groups of students perceive education that suits their educational skills. However,  tracking  can  affect educational equity if the selection process is biased and children with a certain background are structurally located to lower tracks. The effects of tracking are that students are both viewed and treated differently depending on which track they take. It can generate unequal achievement levels between  individual  students  and  it  can  restrict  access  to  higher tracks and higher education. The quality of teaching and curricula vary  between  tracks  and  as  a  result,  those  of  the  lower  track  is

disadvantaged with inferior resources, teachers, etc. In many cases, tracking stunts students who may develop the ability to excel past their original placement.

## Tracking systems

The  type  of  tracking  has  an  impact  on  the  level  of  educational equity, which is especially determined by the degree to which the system  is differentiated. Less differentiated systems, such  as standardized comprehensive schools, reach higher levels of equity in comparison to more differentiated, or tracked systems.

Within  the  tracked  systems,  the  kind  of  differentiation  matters as  well  for  educational  equity.  Differentiation  of  schools  could  be organized  externally  or  internally.  External  differentiation  means that tracks are separated in different schools. Certain schools follow a certain track, which prepares students for academic or professional education, or career or vocational education. This form is less beneficial for educational equity than internal differentiation or course-by-course tracking. Internal tracking means that, within a single school, courses are instructed at different levels, which is a less rigid kind of tracking that allows for more mobility.

The  organization  of  the  tracking  systems  themselves  is  also important for its effect on educational equity. For both differentiation  systems,  a  higher  number  of  tracks  and  a  smaller number of students per track is granting more educational equity. In addition, the effects of tracking are less rigid and have a smaller impact on equity if the students are located in tracks when they are older. The earlier the students undergo educational selection, the less mobile they are to develop their abilities, and the less they can benefit from peer effects.

## Income and Equity

Income has always played an important role in shaping academic success. Those who come from a family of a higher socioeconomic status (SES) are privileged with more opportunities than those of lower SES. Those who come from a higher SES can afford things like better tutors, rigorous SAT/ACT prep classes, impressive summer programs,  and  so  on.  Parents  generally  feel  more  comfortable intervening on behalf of their children to acquire better grades or more qualified teachers. Parents of a higher SES are more willing to  donate  large  sums  of  money  to  a  certain  institution  to  better improve  their  child's  chances  of  acceptance,  along  with  other extravagant  measures.  This  creates  an  unfair  advantage  and  a distinct class barrier.

## Costs of education

The extraordinarily high cost of the many prestigious high schools and universities in the United States makes an attempt at a 'level playing  field'  for  all  students  not  so  level.  High-achieving  lowincome students do not have the means to attend selective schools that  better  prepare  a  student  for  later  success.  Because  of  this, low-income  students  do  not  even  attempt  to  apply  to  the  toptier  schools  for  which  they  are  more  than  qualified.  In  addition, neighborhoods  generally  segregated  by  class  leave  lower-income students  in  lower-quality  schools.  For  higher-quality  schooling, students in low-income areas would have to take public transport which they can't pay for.  Fewer than 30 percent of students in the bottom quarter of incomes even enroll in a four-year school and among that group, fewer than half graduate.

## Race and Equity

From a scientific point of view, the human species is a single species. Nevertheless, the term racial group is enshrined in legislation, and phrases such as race equality and race relations are in widespread official  use.  Racial  equity  in  education  means  the  assignment  of students  to  public  schools  and  within  schools  without  regard  to their race. This includes providing students with a full opportunity for participation in all educational programs regardless of their race.

The  educational  system  and  its  response  to  racial  concerns  in education vary from country to country. Below are some examples of countries that have to deal with racial discrimination in education.

- US Department of Education: The Commission on Equity and Excellence in Education issued a seminal report in 2013, a blueprint for making the dream of equity, and a world-class education, for each and every American child a reality.

The struggle for equality of access to formal education and equality of excellent educational outcomes is part of the history of education in  this  country  and  is  tied  up  with  the  economic,  political,  social history of the peoples who are part of it. From the beginning of this nation, there were many barriers to the schooling and education of girls and racial, national origin, and language groups not from the dominant culture. Approaches and resources for achieving equality and equity in  the  public  schooling  of  girls  and  ethnic,  racial,  and language minority groups are still evolving.

- Asia-Pacific Region: Globalization of the economy, increasingly diverse and interconnected populations, and rapid technological change are posing new and demanding challenges to individuals and societies alike. School systems are rethinking the knowledge and skills students need for success, and the educational strategies and systems required

for all children to achieve them. Within the Asia-Pacific region, for example, Korea, Shanghai-China, and Japan are examples of Asian education systems that have climbed the ladder to the top in both quality and equity indicators.

- South Africa: A major task of South Africa's new government in 1994 was to promote racial equity in the state education system. During the apartheid era, which began when the National Party won control of Parliament in 1948 and ended with a negotiated settlement more than four decades later, the provision of education was racially unequal by design. Resources were lavished on schools serving white students while schools serving the black majority were systematically deprived of qualified teachers, physical resources, and teaching aids such as textbooks and stationery. The rationale for such inequity was a matter of public record.

## Gender and Equity

Gender  equity  in  practicality  refers  to  both  male  and  female concerns,  yet  most  of  the  gender  bias  is  against  women  in  the developing world. Gender discrimination in education has been a very evident and underlying problem in many countries, especially in developing countries where cultural and societal stigma continues  to  hinder  growth  and  prosperity  for  women.  Global Campaign  for  Education  (GCE)  followed  a  survey  called  'Gender Discrimination  in  Violation  of  Rights  of  Women  and  Girls'  which states that one-tenth of girls in primary school is 'unhappy' and this number increases  to  one-fifth  by  the  time  they  reach  secondary schools. Some of the reasons that girls provided include harassment,  restorations  to  freedom,  and  an  inherent  lack  of opportunities,  compared  to  boys.  United  Nations  Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) understands Education  as  a  fundamental  human  right  and  essential  for  the

exercise of all other human rights. It promotes individual freedom and empowerment and yields important development benefits.

Gender-based inequity in education is not just a phenomenon in developing countries. An article in The New York Times highlighted how education systems, especially the public school system, tend to  cause  segregation  between  genders.  Boys  and  girls  are  often taught with different approaches, which programs children to think they are different and deserve different treatment. However, studies show that boys and girls learn differently, and therefore should be taught differently. Boys learn better when they keep moving, while girls  learn  better  sitting  in  one  place  with  silence.  Therefore-in this reasoning-segregating the genders promotes gender equity in education, as both boys and girls have optimized learning.

## Impact of gender discrimination on the economy

Education is universally acknowledged as an essential human right because it highly impacts the socio-economic and cultural aspects of  a  country.  Equity  in  education  increases  the  workforce  of  the nation, therefore increasing national income, and economic productivity. It reduces fertility and infant mortality, improves child health,  increases  life  expectancy,  and  increases  living  standards. These are factors that allow economic stability and growth in the future. Above all, female education can increase output levels and allow  countries  to  attain  sustainable  development.  Equity  in  the education of women also reduces the possibilities of trafficking and exploitation of women. UNESCO also refers to gender equity as a major factor that allows for sustainable development.

## Challenges in Educational Equity

The long-term social and economic consequences of having little education are more tangible now than ever before. Those without the skills to participate socially and  economically in society generate higher costs of healthcare, income support, child welfare, and social security.

While both basic education and higher education have both been improved and expanded in the past 50 years, this has not translated to a more equal society in terms of academics. While the feminist movement has made great strides for women, other groups have not been as fortunate. Generally, social mobility has not increased, while economic inequality has. So, while more students are getting a basic education and even attending universities, a dramatic divide is present and many people are still being left behind.

## TEACHERS AND THE PROFESSION

## 7. What are the Ethical and Legal Issues in Schools?

MYRA HAULMARK AND JENNIFER BEASLEY

Let's examine some of the rights guaranteed to all Americans and how  those  rights  change  once  they  enter  school.  We  will  also answer some of the most common questions held by students. What is  free  speech?  Is  it  protected  in  school?  How  safe  am  I  in  my possessions? Do I have any expectation of privacy when it comes to  my  things?  A  good  understanding  of  students'  rights  benefits everyone:  the  students  who  exercise  them,  the  teachers  who challenge them, and the democratic society which lives by them. Lawsuits  have  become  increasingly  common  in  our  society  and many Americans act  and  speak  out  of  the  fear  of  being  taken  to court.  In  any  environment,  one  must  be  conscious  of  how  their words and actions will affect others.

A thoughtless statement or inappropriate physical contact might land  you  in  court.  This  is  especially  true  in  schools,  where  daily contact,  high  emotions  and  stressful  circumstances  can  all  come together at the wrong moment. As such, it is good to understand the rights of students trying to express themselves and the rights of teachers trying to keep a safe, orderly learning environment. Few people  know  their  constitutional  rights,  and  even  fewer  teachers &amp; students know how their constitutional rights change once they enter the 'semi-public/semi-private' classroom.

- A cheerleader is suspended for using inappropriate language on social media after school.
- Male Texas student suspended for violating dress code by wearing nail polish.
- Student suspended for having a BB gun in his bedroom during virtual class.

- Broward teacher banned over alleged sexual comments.
- Teacher fired after being accused of forcing student to dig waste out of toilet.

All  of  the  above  cases  are  real  and  recent  headlines.  The  cases represent  a  variety  of  the  legal  and  ethical  areas  of  the  teaching profession that exist today. Since the majority of teacher preparation candidates do not have legal backgrounds, this chapter exists to provide an overview of some of the pitfalls that can plague not only the new teacher but those that have been in the profession for  years.  The  legal  landscape  of  the  teaching  profession  seems to  be  ever  evolving  with  increasingly  complex  ethical  and  moral challenges. While this chapter will in no way be all inclusive, it will provide you some basics and food for thought.

This  section  of  the  chapter  will discuss  professional  ethics  and  the teaching profession with the takeaway being that you will be able to  discern  the  difference  between

![Image](output_md\Introduction-to-Education-1701296386_artifacts\image_000036_c17fcb46f444c1e08628dbcc9342d94d960a9135529565794395c4e889072974.png)

your legal responsibilities and ethical ones and the impact that your ability  to  make  sound  decisions  will  keep  you  from  potentially hurting a student and your teaching career.  Knowing your ethical responsibilities  and  how  to  practice  ethical  decision  making  can mitigate the teacher's risk. Having some training in ethical decision making  can  serve  as  a  foundation  to  build  your  philosophy  of education.

So why discuss ethics? Within teaching there is a unique set of ethical relationships and legal obligations that are embedded in the work  of  a  teacher.  Teachers  have  this  awesome  responsibility  to build moral character and be an example of that too. In the article section 'What Professional Ethics Mean' Dr. Troy Hutchings (2016) states:

'The misperceptions blurring the lines between personal and professional ethics become even more difficult to address when we think about the ethics of education. I personally believe the reasons why these misperceptions exist go back to the roots of public

education in this country. We've long thought of teaching as being an extension of parenting - a moral good that has seemingly obvious guidelines for what should be done in any situation. As a result, teachers, like parents, are expected - and expect themselves - to follow their own personal morality and life experience as they make decisions. We're often expected to innately know the best way to address any problem that involves the children we serve.'

From preschool to high school teachers have an enormous impact on students. At the heart of the matter, the teacher's relationship to a student is a special kind of power as students can be considered impressionable and malleable. Because of this power there can be the  potential  abuse  of  power.  We  all  have  seen  headlines  of  this 'abuse' of power and generally once we see these headlines, they are not only violations of ethical standards that are occurring, but now illegal behaviors.

Questions for you to think about are:

Does the lack of ethical decision making happen all at once?

Where does it go wrong?

What types of  ethical  decisions  do  teachers  make  that  may  fly under the radar?

## What are ethics?

'Ethics is knowing the difference between what you have a right to do and what is right to do.' Supreme Court Justice Potter Stuart

Ethics refers  to  well-founded standards  of  right  and  wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights,  obligations,  benefits  to society, fairness, or specific virtues. Ethics, for example, refers  to  those  standards  that impose  the  reasonable  obligations  to  refrain  from  rape,  stealing, murder, assault, slander, and fraud. Ethics can also be defined as a system or code of morality embraced by a person or group.

Ethical standards also include those that enjoin virtues of honesty, compassion, and loyalty; as well as including standards relating to rights, such as the right to life, the right to freedom from injury, and the right to privacy.

But  ethics  applies  as  much  to  the  behavior  of  the  atheist  as  to that  of  the  devout  religious  person.  Religion  can  set  high  ethical standards and can provide intense motivations for ethical behavior. Ethics, however, cannot be confined to religion nor is it the same as religion.

How are ethics different from laws?

Laws are related but more formal, they are written and they must be followed. Ethical norms tend to be broader and more informal than  laws.  Although  most  societies  use  laws  to  enforce  widely accepted  moral  standards  and  ethical  and  legal  rules  use  similar concepts, ethics and law are not the same. An action may be legal but unethical or illegal but ethical.

Howe (1986) specifically mentions that ethical judgement consists of six characteristics: appreciation for moral deliberation, empathy, knowledge, reasoning, courage and interpersonal skills. So you may be thinking that's great - I have those characteristics most of the time  so  I  should  be  fine!  What  is  the  problem  with  this  line  of

thinking? The problem becomes the reliance solely on a teacher's personal  code  of  ethics  that  may  rely  on  many  varying  moral standards.

'That's why we, as a profession, need to shift away from the idea that  our  personal  sense  of  ethics  -  driven  in  large  part  by  our upbringing and our life experiences - is enough to help us navigate all  the  situations we face in the classroom. Even the expectations and norms that evolve in each school vary so much that they alone can't serve as the sole guide to our decisions. And along with the need  for  collective  understanding  of  the  challenges  we  face  as professionals, we need to acknowledge the inherent risks - ethical, practical and often legal - teachers face on a daily basis…'

Ryan, Cooper, Bollick (2016) put it like this: 'some people's codes of  ethics  are  like  a  beacon  and  some  are  a  dim  light  in  a  dark room' therefore clarifying the need to have written codes of ethics for teachers. However, where some professions such as attorneys and  medical  doctors  have  this  universal  code,  there  is  not  yet  a standard code of ethics accepted for all teachers. Some short strides have  been  made  with  NEA  (National  Education  Association)  and NASDTEC  (National  Association  of  State  Directors  of  Teacher Education  and  Certification)  but  most  states  rely  on  their  own individual codes or teachers adhere to district policy on behavior, often in the form of codes of conduct where there are disciplinary actions if there is a violation of those codes of conduct.

Take some to review the below Codes of Ethics from state and national  organizations?  Which  are  more  detailed  and  provide  the clearest standards?

Arkansas Code of Ethics NEA (National Education Association) NASDTEC  (National  Association  of  State  Directors  of  Teacher Education and Certification)

What do you think? Many teachers make decisions in isolation out of fear they will spark the perception they are being unethical.

In the above video, Dr. Troy Hutchins speaks with teachers about the  need  for  a  code  of  ethics  or  a  common  decision  making framework  for  ethics.   Describe  what  might  go  through  a  new teacher's  mind  as  they  are  encountering  an  ethical  decision  they may need to make - What can be done to help teachers make ethical decisions and ask for assistance if needed? What can a teacher do to mitigate any negative perceptions if they talk to someone about an ethical dilemma? What can the school do to support teachers?

Schools and the Law

## The Hierarchy of the System

Who oversees school systems? The public school governing system is actually a hierarchy (March, 1978). There are several tiers to this hierarchy  beginning  with  the  federal  level  and  ending  with  the individual teachers. It is a pyramid of administrators doing everything they can to educate today's students.

## Federal and State

While some may believe that administration of schools starts with the federal government, the truth is that on the federal level there is very little involvement in education, even in funding (Federal Role, n.d.).  The  federal  government sets some guidelines for education, such as the 'Every Student Succeeds Act', but not specific ones such as curriculum taught. In actuality, the states have most of the power over their own schools and what they teach (Education Commission of the States [ECS], 1999). The states set what the students will learn and what standards they have to meet. This means that if a child is meeting their grade level standard in Tennessee they may or may not be meeting the Virginia standards for that grade level. States try to decide what knowledge is imperative for students to learn before they move on to the next grade or even college (ECS, 1999).

The  'Common  Core  Standards'  are  an  attempt  to  'level  the playing  field.'   The  process  began  in  2009  with  a  group  of  state governors  and  school  officials.     The  idea  was  to  create  real-life, relevant  learning  goals  that  could  be  adopted  by  states,  and  lead

to  our  students learning the same things at the same time.  With this idea, that same student in Tennessee would be working on the same standards as the student in Virginia.  The CCS, however, were not mandated by the federal government, nor created by the federal government and this is important to know.  It was a state initiative and  states  had  the  right  to  adopt  the  standards  or  not.     Not  all states have adopted the CCS, and some adopted the standards and then  repealed  them.     More  information  on  the  Common  Core Standards can be found at Common Core State Standards Initiative.

Michigan adopted the standards in 2010.  Michigan has used the CCS  to  create  our  learning  standards.     Michigan's  curriculum standards can be found on the Michigan Academic Standards Page.

States  also  choose  the  standards  that  the  teachers  must  meet (ECS,  1999).  The  state  wants  the  teacher  to  be  able  to  educate the  students  to  achieve  the  set  standards.  There  are  things  that every  state  requires,  but  each  of  them  has  their  own  variation. Every state requires the teacher to have a college degree and some form  of  standardized  testing  to  be  able  to  teach  in  their  public school  system.  There  are  national  tests  available,  but  each  state requires different ones. Teachers moving to a different state may be required to complete a new test or even a new course before gaining certification in that state.

States  have  the  largest  financial  role  in  the  schools.  Very  little funding  comes  from  the  federal  government.  Most  of  the  federal funding is applied for by the individual school in the form of a grant for a special purpose (Federal Role, n.d.). The states provide teacher salaries  and  the  money  required  to  run  each  individual  school. Schools  may  also  have  a  Parent/Teacher  Association   which  can help to raise additional funds for individual schools.  (ECS, 1999).

Hierarchy Tiers on a District Level

School Board

Superintendent

Principal

Teacher

## District

Each state is broken up into districts (ECS, 1999). Most administration deals on a small level, either within the district, or in the individual school (March, 1978). The districts each have their own  school board made  of elected members  (Office of the Education  Ombudsman,  n.d.).  Those  boards  decide  how  their schools will achieve the standards set by the state. They will also decide  anything  else  they  believe  the  schools  should  be  doing  to service  their  district's  children.  Some  of  these  things  include overseeing the curriculum and helping to promote better teaching techniques (Education Administrators, n.d.). The board has to have all  schools  achieving  at  a  level  set  by  the  state,  so  they  use  their resources to push the schools to achieve the standards they have set (ECS, 1999).

## Superintendent

A  superintendent is  chosen  to  oversee  the  schools  in  the  district (ECS, 1999).  While the school board is elected by the community, the superintendent is hired by the school board.  Anyone who meets the qualifications may apply.  The school board conducts interviews and  makes  the  decision  on  which  individual  to  hire.   Sometimes individuals from within the district are  hired, and other times the individual  hired  comes  from  outside  of  the  district.   They  are  in charge of making sure the schools are doing what is required by the school board. They make routine visits to schools to check on how they are doing. They work with the principals and teachers to see that children are getting the most out of each school day.

## Principal and Assistant Principal

The district hires principals to oversee each individual school. These principals are there to see that the teachers are doing their job and the children are getting the education they deserve (Office of the Education Ombudsman, n.d.). They are responsible for scheduling, planning the daily activities, and managing the overall activities of the  school  (Office  of  the  Education  Ombudsman,  n.d.).  Principals make routine visits  to  classrooms  to  make  sure  they  are  running smoothly and that teachers are making the most of their instructional  time.  Another  difficult  duty  of  the  principal  is  the budget for the school. The principal must decide how to best spend the school's money (Education Administrators, n.d.).

The schools also have assistant principals. These administrators help  the  principal  in  the  daily  activities  of  the  school.  They  also handle  most  of  the  discipline  problems  leaving  the  principal available to focus on other duties (Education Administrators, n.d.).

## Teacher

Each school district  is responsible for the hire of their teachers.  In some districts there is a hiring committee formed to interview and recommend teachers to hire.   In  other  districts  the  school  board interviews and there are some districts where the individual school will conduct interviews and make a recommendation to the board.

The teacher is the one with the most direct affect on students. They ultimately decide what happens in the classrooms (ECS, 1999). When the door closes every morning it is up to the teacher to make an effective use of time and get children to those standards set by the state. If children in their classrooms are not performing well, the teacher is held responsible.  It's vital that we hire individuals with

the 'right stuff' to make learning fun and a successful experience for children.

Once you have completed all of the necessary requirements of your  educator  preparation  program  to  earn  a  teaching  license  in your state, there will be ongoing work for you to not only maintain it  but  protect  it  as  well.  Each  state  has  specific  laws  in  place  to protect both the student and teacher, in addition each state may also have certain sets of laws that prohibit someone from becoming licensed  as  well.  Immoral  conduct  and  willful  neglect  of  duty  are some of the most common reasons that teachers are fired today. The above paragraphs overview the role ethics impact a teacher's daily  decision  making  and  the  following  paragraphs  will  overview some of the laws and results of court cases that may impact your work as a teacher. (Teachers' Rights in the Classroom )

## Freedom of Expression

A  court  case  in  which  a  teacher  criticized  the  school  board's financial policies and was fired. He took the case to the Supreme Court and won. Teachers are guaranteed the right to express their opinions and beliefs under the First Amendment, as long as they do not disrupt the business of the school and the learning environment.

Pickering v. Board of Education of Township High School (1968)

- Teacher wrote a letter-to-the-editor about school board tax/ revenue spending and was then fired by the school board.
- Teacher sued the school board in violation of 1st Amendment rights.
- SCOTUS 9-0:  The school board, as a government agency,

violated both the 1st and 14th amendments of the teacher. SCOTUS ruled that teachers, though employed by the school district/government, were still private citizens and their free speech, as long as not slanderous or false, was protected from firing by the school board/government.

Pickering Balance Test for Freedom of Expression for Teachers:

- Need for harmony in the workplace.
- Close working relationship - does the speech violate it.
- The time, place, and manner of the speech.
- The context of the dispute.
- The degree of public interest in the speech.
- Does the speech impede or impair the teacher's ability to perform their duties.

Mt. Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle (1977)

- A teacher claimed he was not rehired due to his Free Speech activities.
- The teacher in question had, during the same year, become hostile with other teachers and school employees, swore at students, and committed obscene gestures at work.
- SCOTUS 9-0: While the teacher did engage in free speech activities, his firing was not a result of those free speech activities, nor did his free speech activities factor into his firing.  His 'behavior' had been documented by the school prior to his free speech activities.

## Academic Freedom

Fowler v. Board of Education of Lincoln County (1987)

- Fowler was fired after showing an R-rated movie (Pink Floyd -

The Wall) to students as a reward on the last day of class, a movie she had not personally seen and did not watch with the student.

- Fowler said her termination was unlawful under Free Speech and the tradition of academic freedom.
- Ruling by Federal court: Free speech only applies when it is expressive or communicative.  Because Fowler did not watch the movie with the students to explain or answer questions and/or the movie did not have an inherent educational value, she could not claim free speech or academic freedom and her termination was lawful.

## Wilson v. Chancellor (1976)

- A government teacher had various political party speakers come in and talk to their class; however, when a Communist was invited the school board banned all political speakers before the presentation date.
- Does banning 'all political speakers' violate the 1st and 14th amendment?
- Federal District court ruled that the school district violated the teachers freedom of expression as part of the teachers established method of instruction of inviting guest speakers germane to the topic of instruction.  Banning 'all political speakers' in this instance was unconstitutional.

Overview of Special Education Law

## Special Educational Needs

Three People on the Margins

The First Person: In 1761 a six-year-old girl was captured from West Africa, given the name Phillis Wheatley, and sold into slavery in the City  of  Boston.  By  the  time  she  was  17,  Phillis  had  taught  herself to read and write and had developed a special love and talent for poetry.  Her  owner  was  a  wealthy  businessman  and  sought  to improve his reputation by publishing an anthology of her poems. Unfortunately  he  encountered  stiff  resistance  from  publishers because few people at that time believed Africans to be capable of the thought and imagination needed to write poetry. People who heard of her poetry were skeptical and inclined to think that it was faked. Eventually, to save his own reputation, the owner assembled a  tribunal  of  18  prominent  judges-including  the  governor  of

Massachusetts  and  John  Hancock,  one  of  the  signers  of  the Declaration of Independence-to assess the young woman's mental capacity. After cross-examining her, the judges finally decided that Ms.  Wheatley  was,  after  all,  capable  of  writing  poetry  (Robinson, 1982).

The Second Person: A century later, a child named Helen Keller lost  her  sight  and  hearing  as  a  result  of  illness  during  infancy.  In spite  of  this  misfortune,  though,  Helen  devised  a  language  of gestural signs for communicating with a tutor, and was soon also using Braille to study both French and Latin. At ten she wrote and published a short story. Yet like Ms. Wheatley, Ms. Keller also faced substantial,  chronic  skepticism  about  her  capacities.  Prominent educators accused her of plagiarizing others' writings and merely 'parroting' others' ideas without understanding them (Keller, 1954; Bogdan, 2006). Eventually, as with Wheatley, a panel was assembled-though  this time the members  were  professional experts about disabilities-to determine whether Ms. Keller was in fact capable of writing what she published. The panel decided that was indeed capable, though only by a slim margin (five judges vs. four judges).

The Third Person: In 1978, Sue Rubin was born with a disability that limited her speech to disordered bursts of sound  and occasionally  echoing  phrases  of  other  people.  She  was  labeled autistic  because of her symptoms, and assumed to be profoundly retarded. With support and encouragement from her mother and others,  however,  Sue  eventually  learned  to  type  on  a  keyboard without assistance. She learned to communicate effectively when she was about 13 and was able to go to school. Since then she has made many presentations about autism at conferences and recently co-edited  a  book  about  autism,  titled  Autism:  The  Myth  of  the Person Alone (Bogdan, et al., 2005).

One  of  these  individuals  experienced  racial  discrimination  and the other two experienced physical disabilities, but notice something  important:  that  all  three  were  defined  by  society  as disabled intellectually. Initially, their achievements were dismissed

because of widespread assumptions-whether about race or disability-of  their  inherent  incompetence.  All  three  had  to  work harder  than  usual,  not  only  to  acquire  literacy  itself,  but  also  to prove that their literacy was genuine and worthy of respect.

Since  the  time  of  Phillis  Wheatley,  North  American  society  has eliminated  slavery  and  made  some  progress  at  reducing  certain forms  of  racism,  though  much  remains  to  be  done.  In  1954,  for example, the United States Supreme Court ruled that public schools could not be segregated by race, and in doing so recognized, at least legally,  the  moral obligation of society to provide all citizens with the best possible education. It has taken longer to recognize legally the rights and competence of persons with disabilities, but events and trends beginning in the 1970s have begun to make it happen. This chapter begins by explaining some of these and how they have altered the work of teachers.

## Growing Support for People with Disabilities: Legislation and Its Effects

Since the 1970s political and social attitudes have moved increasingly  toward  including  people  with  disabilities  into  a  wide variety  of  'regular'  activities.  In  the  United  States,  the  shift  is illustrated clearly in the Federal legislation that was enacted during this time. The legislation partly stimulated the change in attitudes, but at the same time they partly resulted from the change. Three major laws were passed that guaranteed the rights of persons with disabilities, and  of children and  students with disabilities in particular.  Although  the  first  two  affected  teachers'  work  in  the classroom, the third has had the biggest impact on education.

## Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504

This  law-the  first  of  its  kind-required  that  individuals  with disabilities  be  accommodated  in  any  program  or  activity  that receives  Federal  funding  (PL  93-112,  1973).  Although  this  law  was not intended specifically for education, in practice it has protected students' rights in some  extra-curricular activities (for older students)  and  in  some  child  care  or  after-school  care  programs (for  younger  students).  If  those  programs  receive  Federal  funding of  any  kind,  the  programs  are  not  allowed  to  exclude  children  or youth  with  disabilities,  and  they  have  to  find  reasonable  ways  to accommodate the individuals' disabilities.

The definition of a disability under Section 504 is much broader than under another law providing special education services, 'The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.'  Therefore, many of our students may receive special services under the umbrella of Section 504.   These  students  will  be  in  general  education  classrooms  and you will have to make the necessary accommodations for them.

## Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (or ADA).

This  legislation  also  prohibited  discrimination  on  the  basis  of disability, just as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act had done (PL 101-336, 1990). Although the ADA also applies to all people (not just to  students),  its  provisions  are  more  specific  and  'stronger'  than those of Section 504. In particular, ADA extends to all employment and jobs, not just those receiving Federal funding. It also specifically requires  accommodations  to  be  made  in  public  facilities  such  as buses,  restrooms,  and  telephones.  ADA  legislation  is  therefore responsible for some of the 'minor' renovations in schools that you may have noticed, such as wheelchair-accessible doors, ramps, and restrooms, and public telephones with volume controls.

## Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (or IDEA)

As its name implied, this legislation was more focused on education than  either  Section  504  or  ADA.  It  was  first  passed  in  1975  and has been amended several times since, including most recently in 2004 (PL 108-446, 2004). In its current form, the law guarantees the following  rights  related  to  education  for  anyone  with  a  disability from  birth  to  age  21.   In  Michigan,  services  are  provided  for individuals with disabilities until the age of 26.

- Free, appropriate education: An individual or an individual's family should not have to pay for education simply because the individual has a disability, and the educational program should be truly educational (i.e. not merely caretaking or 'babysitting' of the person).
- Due process: In case of disagreements between an individual with a disability and the schools or other professionals, there must be procedures for resolving the disagreements that are fair and accessible to all parties-including the person himself or herself or the person's representative.
- Fair evaluation of performance in spite of disability: Tests or other evaluations should not assume test-taking skills that a person with a disability cannot reasonably be expected to have, such as holding a pencil, hearing or seeing questions, working quickly, or understanding and speaking orally. Evaluation procedures should be modified to allow for these differences. This provision of the law applies both to evaluations made by teachers and to school-wide or 'highstakes' testing programs.
- Education in the 'least restrictive environment': Education for someone with a disability should provide as many educational opportunities and options for the person as possible, both in the short term and in the long term. In practice this requirement has meant including students in general education classrooms and school activities as much as

- possible, though often not totally.
- An individualized educational program: Given that every disability is unique, instructional planning for a person with a disability should be unique or individualized as well. In practice this provision has led to classroom teachers planning individualized programs jointly with other professionals (like reading specialists, psychologists, or medical personnel) as part of a team.  Parents are also a part of this team, and when students are old enough, they can be a part of this process also.  These plans, often referred to as an 'IEP', are reviewed annually and revised.  In some cases, these can be reviewed each semester, or as needed.

Considered together, these provisions are both a cause and an effect of basic democratic philosophy. The legislation says, in effect, that all  individuals  should  have  access  to  society  in  general  and  to education  in  particular.  Although  teachers  certainly  support  this philosophy  in  broad  terms,  and  many  have  welcomed  the  IDEA legislation,  others  have  found  the  prospect  of  applying  it  in classrooms  leads  to  a  number  of  questions  and  concerns.  Some ask,  for  example,  whether  a  student  with  a  disability  will  disrupt the class; others, whether the student will interfere with covering the curriculum; still others, whether the student might be teased by classmates. Since these are legitimate concerns, I will return to them at the end of this chapter. First, however, let me clarify exactly how  the  IDEA  legislation  affects  the  work  of  teachers,  and  then describe in more detail the major disabilities that you are likely to encounter in students.

## Responsibilities of Teachers for Students with Disabilities

The IDEA legislation has affected the work of teachers by creating

three new  expectations. The first expectation is to provide alternative  methods  of  assessment  for  students  with  disabilities. The second is to arrange a learning environment that is as normal or as 'least restrictive' as possible, and the third is to participate in creating individual educational plans for students with disabilities.

## Alternative Assessments

Assessments are used in education to determine the strengths of our students, and areas that need further development, and then use  that  information  to  plan  educational  experiences.   In  the context of students with disabilities, assessment refers to gathering information about a student in order both to identify the strengths of the student, and to decide what special educational support, if any, the student needs. In principle, of course, these are tasks that teachers have for all students: assessment is a major reason why we give tests and assignments, for example, and why we listen carefully to the quality of students' comments during class discussions. For students with disabilities, however, such traditional or conventional strategies of assessment often seriously underestimate the students' competence (Koretz &amp; Barton, 2003/2004; Pullin, 2005). Depending on the disability, a student may have trouble with

1. holding a pencil,
2. hearing a question clearly,
3. focusing on a picture,
4. marking an answer in time even when he or she knows the answer,
5. concentrating on a task in the presence of other people, or
6. answering a question at the pace needed by the rest of the class.

There are many more concerns a student may have, but the point is that we will be dealing with a variety of needs among all of our

students, whether they qualify for special education services or not. The challenge for teachers is meeting the wide variety of needs of our students.  ALL STUDENTS CAN LEARN!  What they learn, how they learn it, and the time it takes to learn it will vary among all of our students.  Keep an open mind always and be willing to make any adaptations that will benefit students.

Traditionally, teachers have assumed that all students either have these skills or can learn them with just modest amounts of coaching, encouragement,  and  will  power.  For  many  other  students,  for example,  it  may  be  enough  to  say  something  like  'Remember  to listen  to  the  question  carefully!'  For  students  with  disabilities, however,  a  comment  like  this  may  not  work  and  may  even  be insensitive. A student with visual impairment need not be reminded to 'look at the page closely' or 'at what I am writing on the board'; doing  so  will  not  cause  the  student  to  see  the  chalkboard  more clearly-though the reminder might increase the student's anxiety and self-consciousness.

We also hear teachers tell students to 'try harder', or to 'do it again  and  this  time  concentrate  or  pay  attention  to  your  work' when  they  are  not  successful  with  a  task,  or  when  students  ask a  question.   Please  don't  do  this!     When  students  ask  a  question, are not successful with an assignment, or stop working, these are all indicators that they are struggling and need support.  Whether they are general education students or students receiving special services, they need to have questions answered and guidance given. Simply telling  them  to  'try  again'  or  'try  harder'  is  insulting  and disrespectful.  Responding in this way will quickly lead to students who may shut down and stop making attempts at their work.  When this happens, we have more problems.

There are a number of strategies for modifying assessments in ways that attempt to be fair and that at the same time recognize how busy teachers usually are. One is to consider supplementing conventional assignments  or  tests with portfolios, which  are collections of a student's  work  that  demonstrate  a  student's development  over  time,  and  which  usually  include  some  sort  of

reflective  or  evaluative  comments  from  the  student,  the  teacher, or both (Carothers &amp; Taylor, 2003; Wesson &amp; King, 1996). Another is  to  devise  a  system  for  observing  the  student  regularly,  even  if briefly,  and  informally recording notes about the observations for later  consideration  and  assessment.  A  third  strategy  is  to  recruit help  from  teacher  assistants,  who  are  sometimes  present  to  help a  student with a disability; an assistant can often conduct a brief test  or  activity  with  the  student,  and  later  report  on  and  discuss the  results  with  you.   Keep  in  mind  that  an  assessment  does  not always mean a test.  Projects and observation can also be powerful and effective assessments.

If you reflect on these strategies, you may realize that they may sometimes create issues about fairness. If a student with a disability demonstrates competence one way but other students demonstrate it another, should they be given similar credit? On the other hand, is  it  fair  for  one  student to get a lower mark because the student lacks an ability-such as normal hearing-that teachers cannot, in principle,  ever  teach?  These  ethical  issues  are  legitimate  and important.

As educators, it is our responsibility to help ALL students learn. We know that every person learns differently, so why would we try to teach all students in the same way?  It's not possible. Therefore, we  have  to  help  students  understand  that  'equal'  and  'fair'  are two different  ideas.   In  our  classrooms,  we  cannot  treat  students equally  and  have  each  of  them  be  successful.  .  We  have  to  adapt to their learning needs.  We will talk more about this later, but we have  to  talk  with  our  students  from  the  very  first  day  about  the practices of the classroom.  They have to understand there will be times when they will be doing things differently from their friends, or vice versa, and it's all in the name of learning; learning that meets their individual needs.

## Least Restrictive Environment

The IDEA legislation calls for placing students with disabilities in the least restrictive environment (or LRE), defined as the combination of  settings  that  involve  the  student  with  regular  classrooms  and school programs as much as possible. The precise combination is determined by the circumstances of a particular school and of the student.  A  kindergarten  child  with  a  mild  cognitive  disability,  for example, may spend the majority of time in the regular kindergarten,  working  alongside  and  playing  with  non-disabled classmates  and  relying  on  a  teacher  assistant  for  help  where needed.  An  individual  with  a  similar  disability  in  high  school, however, might be assigned primarily to classes specially intended for  their  need,  but  nonetheless  participate  in  some  school  wide activities alongside non-disabled students. The difference in LREs might reflect teachers' perceptions of how difficult it is to modify the curriculum in each case; rightly or wrongly, teachers are apt to regard adaptation as more challenging at 'higher' grade levels. By the same token, a student with a disability that is strictly physical might  spend  virtually all his or her time in regular classes throughout the student's school career.  In this case, adjustment of the curriculum would not be an issue.

For  you,  the  policy  favoring  the  least  restrictive  environment means  that  if  you  continue  teaching  long  enough,  you  will  very likely encounter a student with a disability in one or more of your classes, or at least have one in a school-related activity for which you are responsible. It also means that the special educational needs of these students will most often be the 'mildest.' Statistically, the most frequent forms of special needs are learning disabilities, which are  impairments  in  specific  aspects  of  learning,  and  especially  of reading.  Learning  disabilities  account  for  about  half  of  all  special educational needs-as  much  as  all  other  types  put  together. Somewhat  less common  are  speech  and  language  disorders, cognitive disabilities, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (abbreviated ADHD). Because of their frequency and of the

likelihood that you will meet students for whom these labels have been considered, I describe them more fully later in this chapter, along with other disability conditions that you will encounter much less frequently.

## Individual Educational Plan

The  third way  that IDEA  legislation  and  current  educational approaches  affect  teachers  is  by  requiring  teachers  and  other professional staff to develop an annual individual educational plan (or IEP) for each student with a disability. The plan is created by a team of individuals who know the student's strengths and needs; at a minimum it includes one or more classroom teachers, a 'resource' or special education teacher, and the student's parents or guardians. Sometimes,  too,  the  team  includes  a  school  administrator  (like  a vice-principal) or other professionals from outside the school (like a psychologist or physician), depending on the nature of the child's disability.  An  IEP  can  take  many  forms,  but  it  always  describes  a student's  current  social  and  academic  strengths  as  well  as  the student's  social  or  academic  needs.  It  also  specifies  educational goals  or  objectives  for  the  coming  year,  lists  special  services  to be provided, and describes how progress toward the goals will be assessed at the end of year. IEPs originally served mainly students in the younger grades, but more recently they have been extended and  modified  to  serve  transition  planning  for  adolescents  with disabilities who are approaching the end of their public schooling (West, et al., 1999). For these students, the goals of the plan often include  activities  (like  finding  employment)  to  extend  beyond schooling as such.

If you have a student with an IEP, you can expect two consequences for teaching. The first is that you should expect to make definite, clear plans for the student, and to put the plans in writing.  This  consequence  does  not,  of  course,  prevent  you  from taking advantage of unexpected or spontaneous classroom events

as well in order to enrich the curriculum. But it does mean that an educational program for a student with a disability cannot consist only of the unexpected or spontaneous. The second consequence is that you should not expect to construct an educational plan alone, as it is commonly done when planning regular classroom programs. When it comes to students with disabilities, expect instead to plan as part of a team. Working with others ensures that everyone who is concerned about the student has a voice. It also makes it possible to  improve  the  quality  of  IEPs  by  pooling  ideas  from  many sources-even  if,  as  you  might  suspect,  it  also  can  challenge professionals  to  communicate  clearly  and  cooperate  respectfully with team members in order to serve a student as well as possible.

A student in your class refuses to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Can you send that student to the principal's office?

1. Yes
2. No
3. It depends!

## Students Rights

Student Rights Explained https:/ /www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntEQfooBxTk&amp;t=25s

Religion and Public Schools

The founding fathers deliberated for days on end when writing the first draft of our nation's Constitution and later the Bill of Rights. They  agonized  over  wording;  argued  over  semantics.  It  is  likely they  had  no  idea  just  how  successful  this  'great  experiment  in democracy' would turn out to be. Equally likely is this: they never once considered how these rights would pertain to young students

in the classroom. The landmark case of Tinker v. Des Moines School District  clearly  defined  the  benchmark  for  how  rights  may  be exercised and when they may be curtailed:

'It  can  hardly  be  argued  that  either  students  or  teachers  shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.… On the other hand, the Court has repeatedly emphasized  the  need  for  affirming  the  comprehensive  authority of  the  States  and  of  school  officials,  consistent  with  fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.

… Our problem lies in the area where students in the exercise of [their] rights collide with the rules of the school authorities.'

## Constitutional Topic: Student Rights

In  other  words,  one  doesn't  surrender  his  or  her  constitutional rights  by  attending  school.  However  the  courts  have  recognized that  the  unique  nature  of  the  school  environment  requires  that certain liberties be suppressed in the interest of maintaining a safe, orderly learning environment. According to the doctrine of 'in loco parentis' school officials are more than government officials; they are, in a legal sense, the temporary parents of their students. Just what exactly that allows them to do and say is a matter of debate and  has  led  to  numerous  legal  challenges,  many  involving  the Supreme Court.

## The 1st Amendment

## Freedom of Speech, Expression &amp; Religion

Perhaps the most quoted court decision on the subject, Tinker v.  Des  Moines  was  a  battle  over  students'  1st  amendment  rights, specifically  the  right  to  free  speech.  High  school  students  John Tinker,  15,  and  Christopher  Eckhardt,  16,  decided  to  show  their opposition  to  the  Vietnam  War  by  wearing  black  armbands  to school. Administrators countered by banning armbands and threatened disciplinary actions for any students violating the rule.

Tinker  and  Eckhardt  wore  their  armbands  and  were  suspended, not  allowed  back  until  they  agreed  to  stop  violating  school  rules. Tinker's  father  subsequently  sued  and  lost  in  District  Court.  The Appellate Court was unable to reach a decision and the case was passed  up  to  the  Supreme  Court,  who  overturned  the  District Court's decision and ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. The court stated that if the student's actions did not disrupt the learning environment, or advocate or cause harm to themselves or others, it was permissible. This has been the rationale in virtually every other opinion held by the court regarding student's constitutional rights. Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969)

While  a  student's  right  to  free  speech  is  protected,  it  is  not  a blanket protection covering any form of protest. A recent example of this is Morse v. Frederick, also known as the 'Bong Hits 4 Jesus' case.Morse v. Frederick, 127 S. Ct. 2618 (2007) This case is particularly  eye-opening  in  that  the  offense  occurred  off  school grounds. Frederick, a high school student, displayed a banner at a local  parade featuring the phrase 'Bong Hits 4 Jesus,' a reference to marijuana use. Morse, a school official, noticed the banner and instructed the student to take it down. When Frederick refused, he was suspended by Morse and the decision was upheld by the school board. Frederick sued, claiming protection under his 1st amendment rights. This time the Supreme Court sided with the school board, noting  '  …  schools  may  take  steps  to  safeguard  those  entrusted to  their  care  from  speech  that  can  reasonably  be  regarded  as encouraging illegal drug use, [therefore] the school officials in this case  did  not  violate  the  First  Amendment…'  This  fits  with  the consistent message of the courts - a student's Constitutional rights will be protected only as long as their exercise does not endanger the health or academic progress of others.

Other cases regarding the Rights of Free Speech &amp; Expression: West  Virginia  v.  Barnette,  1943  -  The  court  ruled  that  it  is unconstitutional  to  require  students  to  salute  the  American  flag. The 1st amendment not only protects freedom 'of' expression but

also  freedom  'from'  expression.  West  Virginia  State  Board  of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943)

Bethel School District v. Fraser, 1986 - Washington high school student Matthew Fraser was suspended for using sexually explicit language in a speech given on school grounds. The court sided with the school, affirming that schools can prohibit 'lewd, indecent or plainly offensive' language. Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675 (1986)

Guiles  v.  Marineau,  2004  -  A  14-  year  old  student  in  Vermont was suspended for repeatedly wearing a T-shirt depicting President George  W  Bush  as  an  alcoholic  and  a  cocaine  addict.  The  shirt contained both written and visual depictions of banned substances. The  court  sided  with  the  student,  citing  two  factors:  1)  the  shirt did  not  advocate  the  use  of  illegal  drugs  and  2)  the  shirt  did  not cause significant disruptions to the learning environment. Guiles v. Marineau, 461 F.3d 320, 324-25 (2d. Cir. 2006)

Summary - A student's exercise of speech or expression is legal and constitutionally protected so long as it doesn't:

1. endanger the public
2. disrupt the learning environment
3. advocate the use of illegal substances or other violations of the law

4th Amendment

Unreasonable Search &amp; Seizure https:/ /youtu.be/yexA13FDYxQ

## https:/ /www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY4fPF6dijU

The student's desire for freedom of speech can only be matched by  their  desire  for  privacy  and  for  security  of  their  possessions. The  right  of  school  officials  to  search  a  student's  belongings  is a  contentious  issue,  and  few  teachers  know  the  limits  of  their authority and few students understand the extent of their rights. Just as Tinker v. Des Moines set the standard for the protection of 1st  Amendment rights,  so  did  another  case  set  the  precedent  for search &amp; seizure: New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U.S. 325 (1985).

Two  female  high  school  students  were  caught  smoking  in  the restroom  and  assistant  principal  Theodore  Choplick  confronted them.  One  of  the  two  admitted  her  wrongdoing  but  the  other student  (T.L.O.)  denied  it.  Choplick  searched  T.L.O.'s  purse  and discovered cigarettes, drugs and drug paraphernalia, along with a large  amount  of  money.  T.L.O.  was  tried  and  convicted  in  court on charges of delinquency. The student countered that the school had violated her 4th amendment rights, depriving her of protection against  unreasonable  search  and  seizure  (i.e.  searching  without  a warrant)  and  the  evidence  should  be  inadmissible.  The  Supreme Court disagreed, stating: 'a school official may properly conduct a search of a student's person if the official has a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is in the process of being committed, or reasonable cause to believe that the search is necessary to maintain school discipline or enforce school policies.'

This  is  a  departure  from  the  court's  usual  position  requiring 'probable  cause'  for  government  officials  to  search  someone without  a  warrant.  This  change,  although  appearing  slight,  has enormous ramifications. School officials may search someone based solely  upon  a  well-grounded  suspicion,  not  iron-clad  evidence  of wrongdoing. This is analogous to the difference between 'reasonable  doubt'  and  'beyond  a  shadow  of  a  doubt.'  This threshold  however  applies  only  to  school  personnel  and  NOT  to law  enforcement officials  on  school  grounds.  The  court  has  been careful not to slide down that slippery slope. In the court's decision, they state that a teacher's right to protect him- or herself and the

safety of their students is on par with the rights of firefighters, EMS, OSHA officials, etc. The right to privacy must be balanced against the public's right to safety. In a school, the balance is tilted toward protecting safety and maintaining order, even if it is at the expense of student rights.

The issue of locker searches has not come to the Supreme Court. As the locker is school property and therefore 'public space' it is not afforded the same protections as a student's personal possessions.

State  of  Iowa  v.  Marzel  Jones  (2003)  -  A  student  whose  locker was  cleaned  out  by  school  personnel.  Finding  a  small  amount  of marijuana, the student was charged. Marzel claimed 4th amendment protection against unreasonable search &amp; seizure but was denied by the State Supreme Court who 'noted that the search occurred on school grounds, 'where the State is responsible for maintaining discipline,  health,  and  safety.'(Bd.  of  Ed.  of  Indep.  Sch.  Dist.  92  v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822)'.  State of Iowa vs. Marzel Jones, Appellee 02-505 (2003).

Another issue of concern has been the constitutionality of drug screenings for student-athletes.

Vernonia  School  District  v.  Acton  (1995)  -  7th  grade  Oregon student James Acton signed up to play football but refused to take a mandatory urine test. Drug testing was administered to athletes after  a  recent  'explosion'  in  drug-use  and  the  related  discipline problems which arose. Citing public health concerns and noting the prevalence of student-athletes involved in drug-related incidents, the  school  board  deemed  urinalysis  a  necessary  requirement  for participation in sports. The Supreme Court agreed and upheld their decision. Once again, the desire to protect public health overrode student's desire for privacy.  Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995)

Summary  -  School  personnel  may  search  a  student  and  their belongings if the health &amp; welfare of the public is at risk or they have a 'reasonable suspicion' that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed

## 5th &amp; 14th Amendment

## The Right to Due Process

These amendments protect an individual's right to a fair trial and must be considered whenever 'a person's good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him…' Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433 (1971)

1). This includes the enforcement of disciplinary actions such as suspension  or  expulsion.  The  expectations  of  a  fair  trial  are  very different  however,  depending  on  the  circumstances.  Disciplinary expulsion is treated differently than an 'academic dismissal.' Claire La  Roche  makes  the  point  by  citing  Barnard  v.  Inhabitants  of Shelburne:  'Misconduct  is  a  very  different  matter  from  failure  to attain a standard of excellence in studies…. A public hearing may be regarded as helpful to the ascertainment of misconduct and useless or  harmful  in  finding  out  the  truth  as  to  scholarship.'  (emphasis added)

According to La Roche's interpretation of the courts, the following are necessary in the expulsion of a student on disciplinary grounds:

1. a timely &amp; formal hearing
2. a detailed explanation of the charges
3. a strict adherence to the schools stated policy
4. a 'punishment that fits the crime'

She goes on: 'To ensure fundamental fairness, decisions must be based  on  the  facts  and  supported  by  the  evidence.  Moreover, punishment  should  be  commensurate  with  the  severity  of  the offense.  Consequently,  it  is  important  for  schools  to  establish guidelines and be consistent with sanctions.'

## Other Miscellaneous Cases

The following are other judgments handed down by the Supreme Court:

School uniforms and dress codes are intended to stop disruptions to  the  learning  process  by  banning  lewd,  obscene  or  offensive

clothing. As such, the courts have ruled them constitutional despite students pleading for 'the freedom of expression' and the lesserknown 'freedom to see skin.'

Corporal  punishment  (physically  disciplining  a  student)  barely passed a constitutional challenge in 1977 with a divided court ruling 5-4 that it is neither 'cruel and unusual punishment' nor a denial of  due  process.  (Ingraham  v.  Wright,  430  U.S.  651  [1977])   While corporal  punishment  is  not  allowed  in  Michigan,  there  are  states where it is still legal.

The  censorship  of  school  newspapers  was  upheld  with  the understanding that the school is not a 'forum of public expression.' Further,  the  justices  declared  that  a  school  'need  not  tolerate student  speech  that  is  inconsistent  with  its  basic  educational mission.' (Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260 [1988]).

Additional Information

Religion and the Law

- Prayer, or other religious activities cannot be initiated by the school or teacher
- Prayer and other religious activities are permitted if initiated by students
- Schools must give religious organizations the same access to facilities as they give other secular organizations
- Prayer permitted in school if initiated by students, and does not interfere with the functioning of the school; all students not required to participate
- Schools cannot teach a particular religion, but may teach the history of religion, comparative religions, or the role of religion in the history of the United States or other countries
- No religious symbols permitted

Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin.

Title IX prohibits discrimination based on gender.

Family  Education  Right  and  Privacy  Act  (FERPA):  makes  school

records open to parents and students; must inform parents of their rights regarding records; must provide access; must create procedures  for  allowing  students  and  parents  to  challenge  and/ or  amend information believed to be inaccurate; protects against disclosure  of  confidential  information  to  third  parties  without consent.

## Summary

In  summary,  within  teaching  there  is  a  unique  set  of  ethical relationships and legal obligations that are embedded in the work of a teacher. Teachers have the responsibility to build moral character and be an example of that too. Adhering to a shared code of ethics can assist teachers in mitigating risk and protecting students and themselves.

The federal government makes general regulations for education and  contributes  very  little  funding  for  the  schools  (Federal  Role, n.d.).

The states have most of the power because they are able to set the standards for teachers and students, and they fund the public school system almost completely (ECS, 1999).

The district has the power in the area entrusted to them by the state. Each district has an elected school board that determines how state standards are achieved and anything else they see fit to better the students' education (Office of the Education Ombudsman, n.d.).

The  superintendent  oversees  the  schools  in  the  district  and makes  sure  they  are  following  what  is  set  by  the  states  and  the district (ECS, 1999).

The  principals  manage  their  individual  school  with  assistance from the assistant principal (Office of the Education Ombudsman, n.d.).

The  teachers  instruct  the  students  in  accordance  with  the standards set before them by all levels of the hierarchy.

## 8. What is Taught?

## JENNIFER BEASLEY AND MYRA HAULMARK

Curriculum requires us to keep instruction in mind. Instruction is the way curriculum is taught. Curriculum focuses on learning goals, (Outcomes, Standards, Benchmarks)  while  instruction focuses on the 'how' or the way teachers will help students meet these goals. In this

chapter, the focus will be on how curriculum is defined as well as taught.

## Objectives and Key Terms

## In this chapter, readers will…

- Identify curriculum standards and how they are used to plan lessons

- Describe how educators can differentiate curriculum to meet student needs
- Name the major subject-matter areas taught in elementary and secondary schools

## Key terms in the chapter are…

- Hidden and Formal Curriculum
- Implicit and Explicit Curriculum
- Outcomes
- Standards
- Benchmarks
- Differentiation

## Definitions of Curriculum

Educators  define  curriculum  in  several  ways.  It  can  refer  to  the subject matter taught, the planned experiences, a course of study, or what students are expected to learn. No matter the definition, an educator is bound by the subject he/she teaches and curriculum is the way that it can be organized.

## Four Types of Curriculum

## Explicit Curriculum (Formal)

- The material found in textbooks, teacher's guides
- Everything that teachers are expected to teach, what students are expected to learn, and what schools will be held accountable for; the material we assess
- Elementary curriculum heavy in language arts and math
- Middle school curriculum content places equal time on all subjects
- Junior High/High School content becomes more compartmentalized

## Implicit Curriculum (Informal)

- The 'hidden' information
- What children learn from the nature and organization of the school and classrooms and from the attitudes and behaviors of teachers and administrators
- Tolerance
- Study Skills
- Respect
- Organization
- Team Work
- Values
- These are learned from the way classrooms are set up, the practices used, behaviors modeled, the way material is presented, values and priorities that may be unstated, but are evident

## Null Curriculum

- Topics left out of a course of study
- Sometimes what we don't say or don't teach, carries as strong, or stronger message than what we do teach

## Extra-Curricular

- Learning beyond formal studies
- No academic credit
- Extra-curricular activities are part of an effective school
- Need to reach everyone; high and low achievers; all income levels
- May be sports or clubs, organizations

## Influences on Curriculum

- Education philosophies
- Textbooks
- Federal/State Government
- Local School District/School Board
- Standards and Testing

Standards  in  CurriculumStandards  are  predetermined  statements of  what  students  should  know  and  skills  they  should  have  upon completion  of  an  area  of  study.   In  many  states,  curriculum standards are based upon common standards for the disciplines.

In  2010,  many  states  adopted  the  'Common  Core  Standards'. These are the standards that must be met for each grade level and subject  matter.  You  can  find  Arkansas'  standards  on  the  Arkansas Department of Education website.  This is the curriculum teachers must follow. They are required to present these concepts and skills

to their students. However, the way in which they present and teach this  information  is  entirely  up  to  them.  This  is  where  instruction comes into play. A teacher has the Academic Freedom to structure his/her classroom and learning activities in the manner they feel best in order to present the curriculum to their students and help them master it.

There  are  many  differences  between  what  is  taught  in  an elementary school compared to high school.  The following section will talk about the differences in curriculum.

## Elementary Curriculum

Elementary  education in the United States refers to the first seven  to  nine  years  of  formal

This image is lincensed under CC0.

![Image](output_md\Introduction-to-Education-1701296386_artifacts\image_000041_80cd979f825a58147dfbc53e47345a3b9cdd90d8dbfaf535e5a9b4a871cfa9e7.png)

education  in most  jurisdictions, often in elementary  schools, including  middle  schools.  Preschool  programs,  which  are  less formal and usually not mandated  by  law, are generally not considered  part  of  primary  education.  The  first  year  of  primary education is commonly referred to as kindergarten and begins at or around age 5 or 6. Subsequent years are usually numbered being referred to as first grade, second grade, and so forth. Elementary schools normally continue through sixth grade, which the students normally  complete  when  they  are  age  11  or  12.  Some  elementary schools graduate after the 4th or 5th grade and transition students into a middle school.

Students  may  attend  either  a  4-year,  5-year,  6-year  or  7-year public or private elementary school. Elementary school usually runs from  kindergarten  or  1st  grade  through  either  4th,  5th  or  6th, depending  on  the  region.  Upon  successful  completion  of  their elementary education students then proceed to middle school, also known as junior high school. Depending on the school district, some

students  attend  separate  middle  schools,  beginning  at  6th  grade and  then  completing  at  8th  grade  before  they  transition  to  high school.  Additionally,  students  may  have  the  option  of  attending elementary  schools  that  include  all  eight  primary  grades.  In  this case, the student will directly proceed to High School.

In most U.S. elementary schools, a class of students is assigned to a particular teacher and classroom for an entire school year. Those students will spend the vast majority of that school year together in that one classroom learning from that one teacher, and that teacher is expected to carefully supervise their students at all times (apart from lunch and recess). Well-financed schools can hire specialists to provide instruction in specific subject matter like art, music, and science; at such schools, a teacher will hand off their entire class to specialists for such units and then resume supervision of the class afterwards. This is distinct from the course model followed at the middle  school,  high  school,  and  college  levels,  in  which  students enroll in various courses each semester which is usually taught in different classrooms by different teachers, and therefore must race from one classroom to the next during the school day.

## Secondary Curriculum

Secondary  education  is  often  divided  into  two  phases,  middle/ junior high school and high school. Students are usually given more independence, moving to different classrooms for different subjects, and being allowed to choose some of their class subjects (electives).

'Middle  school'  (or  'junior  high  school')  has  a  variable  range between districts. It usually includes seventh and eighth grades and occasionally also includes one or more of the sixth, ninth, and very occasionally  fifth  grades  as  well.  High  school  (occasionally  senior high school) includes grades 9 through 12. Students in these grades are commonly referred to as freshmen (grade 9), sophomores (grade

10),  juniors  (grade  11),  and  seniors  (grade  12).  At  the  high  school level,  students  generally  take  a  broad  variety  of  classes  without specializing in any particular subject, with the exception of vocational schools. Students are generally required to take a broad range  of  mandatory  subjects  but  may  choose  additional  subjects ('electives') to fill out their required hours of learning. High school grades normally are included in a student's official transcript, e.g. for college admission. Official transcripts usually include the ninth grade, whether it is taught in a middle school or a high school.

Each  state  sets  minimum  requirements  for  how  many  years  of various mandatory subjects are required; these requirements vary widely but generally include 2-4 years of each of Science, Mathematics,  English,  Social  sciences,  Physical  education;  some years  of  a  foreign  language  and  some  form  of  art  education  are often  also  required,  as  is  a  health  curriculum  in  which  students learn about anatomy, nutrition, first aid, sexuality, drug awareness, and birth control. In many cases, however, options are provided for students  to  'test  out'  this  requirement  or  complete  independent study to meet it.

Many high schools provide Honors, Advanced Placement (AP) or International  Baccalaureate  (IB)  courses.  These  are  special  forms of  honors  classes  where  the  curriculum  is  more  challenging  and lessons more aggressively paced than standard courses. Honors, AP, or IB courses are usually taken during the 11th or 12th grade of high school but may be taken as early as 9th grade. Some international schools offer international graduation qualifications, to be studied for  and  awarded instead of or alongside the high school diploma, Honors, Advanced Placement, or International Baccalaureate. Regular  honors  courses  are  more  intense  and  faster-paced  than typical college preparatory courses. AP and IB on the other hand, are college-level classes

Educators  know  every  student  is  different  and  educators  need to try and 'reach' every student. The choice of teaching methods used will  depend  on  each  student  and  the  material  to  be  taught.

Always consider what will be the best way for students to receive and process the information.

We all have recognized that our students will be unique and each will  have  their  own  interests,  needs,  abilities,  and  motivation.   As educators, we have to find a way to reach all of them and address as many of these issues as we can.  In the next section, this will be addressed.

## Instruction

While teachers have little to no control over the formal curriculum, they have a wide range of options when it comes to instruction. Instruction refers to the way in which we present the curriculum to the students. Instruction can lean towards student-centered or teacher-centered.  This section will give examples of each.

## Teacher-Centered

- The teacher is responsible for planning learning activities.
- Passive; students sit and listen as students talk 'at' them. (Direct Instruction)
- The teacher creates all of the guidelines for both behavior and work done in the classroom,
- Classroom organization is determined by the teacher.
- All learning goals are determined by the teacher.

## Student-Centered Instruction

- Students have input into learning activities.
- Instruction and learning activities are tailored to meet students' learning needs and interests.
- Students have input into classroom guidelines and organization.
- Students are also able to set learning goals for themselves in conjunction with learning goals set by the teacher.

The goal is to help students learn, and teachers need to find the strategies that work best for students.  A combination of teachercentered  and  student-centered  seems  to  work  well  in  many

classrooms.   Remember that students have a developmental need to have control over themselves and their world, thus giving them the  power  to  make  decisions  regarding  their  learning  increases motivation, focus and further helps to develop a love of learning.

One instructional strategy that has supported many teachers in their efforts to meet the learning needs of students is 'Differentiated Instruction.'  While  it  takes  some  work  in  the beginning, once you have a 'toolbox' of activities and lessons it is much easier to implement.

Differentiated Instruction refers to our use of a variety of teaching strategies in order to deliver information to our students (Tomlinson, 2014). It also means using a variety of different activities to help reinforce that information. We may use direct instruction, we may have them watch a video, and we may have them create a  project  or  conduct an experiment. The idea is that we vary our teaching strategies in order to meet the needs of our students.

Watch  the  following  video.   How  might  you  describe  this  to someone else?

![Image](output_md\Introduction-to-Education-1701296386_artifacts\image_000044_1066863a0b6b48a5850173a07dc85e77e30ed381fd127d9ea9bb573475348f53.png)

introductiontoeducation/?p=38#oembed-1

## Areas to Differentiate

A  teacher  can  differentiate  content,  product,  process,  or  the learning environment.

- Content (What students learn.)
- Process (How students learn it.)

- Products (What students produce.)
- Learning Environment/ Affect (Environment in which they learn.)
- Assessment (Evidence we use to determine what students are learning.)

Along with varying our instruction and students' products, we also vary our assessments.  So many teachers are 'hung up' on tests and they are not the best way to assess.  Many of these 'products' you ask students to produce can be used as assessments.  Using these will  also  be  a  more  accurate  measure,  in  many  cases,  of  what  a student has learned over a written test you may give them.

## Planning for Instruction

When teachers plan classroom activities, they want to plan with the beginning in mind.  When teachers follow this practice, they begin planning with the standard they are teaching, in other words, what they want the students to learn.  Teachers then plan how they will assess that learning, and finally plan the learning activities for this particular concept.  Simply put:

1. Identify desired results (Standard)
2. Determine acceptable evidence  (Assessment)
3. Plan learning experiences and instruction

When objectives, learning activities, and assessments relate directly to  standards,  they  will  have  'Instructional  Alignment'.   All  of  the lessons should be instructionally aligned.

Let's  look  at  various  strategies  for  instruction.   Some  strategies are better suited to the content being taught than others.  Varying the strategies you use will keep students engaged, and interested, and increase the potential for learning.

## High-Quality Instructional Strategies

## Learning Centers

Areas are set up in the classroom with learning activities directed at a specific concept are often defined as learning centers.  Learning centers can be set up to reinforce skills previously learned, or to help students internalize new concepts.  For example, the learning centers could be used to 'fill in' when students have idle time. If they are finished with work, they can go to the centers and work with  concepts  they  have  previously  been  exposed  to.     You  may have a science center, a creative art center, and maybe a language center. You  can  rotate activities,  thus  giving  students  more exposure  to  concepts  being  taught,  as  well  as  helping  to  engage students in a time of the day when idle hands could cause behavior concerns.

The other way learning centers can be used is to teach a concept. For example, if you wanted to teach the concepts of magnets you would have a  variety  of  centers  set  up  all  dealing  with  magnets. Students  would  move  from  center  to  center,  engaging  in  the planned activities.  You would want to try and design the activities at the centers to tap into the various multiple intelligences.

## RAFT: Role, Audience, Format, Topic

This is a writing strategy that allows for student creativity.  It can be used in a variety of ways, including as an assessment.

ROLE:  Students choose a perspective to write from.

AUDIENCE:  Students choose who they are writing to.

FORMAT:  Students choose the format for writing; letter, memo, poem, advertising ad, etc.

TOPIC: The topic they are writing on.

Here is an example that could be used:

Role:  Abraham Lincoln

Audience:  American People

Format:  Interview

Topic:  The major challenges of his presidency

In this activity, the students would have to decide what the major challenges were in his presidency and be able to explain those.  The student would also design the questions that could be used in the interview  in  regard  to  these  challenges.   For  some  students,  this would be a more engaging and interesting way to report on these versus just writing a 1000-word essay.  You will probably get more information from the student as well.

## Choice Boards

- Students choose from a menu of options
- Tasks vary by process and interest
- Some anchor activities can be required of all students
- Can be used for homework, projects, and assessment, or as again, as a way to fill idle time.

Here is an example that could be used for learning what verbs are:

Choose a book from the reading area and write down 10 verbs

Create a song using five verbs

Choose five verbs and illustrate them

Write a short story and identify the verbs in the story

Listen to a favorite song and identify the verbs

Draw a picture and write a short description of what is happening using at least three verbs

These are all activities that would help reinforce the idea of verbs. Students would be able to choose which of these they would like

to do.  This example has six, but many are made with nine choices. Teachers  can  determine  how  many  activities  students  have  to complete.  The Tic-Tac-Toe choice board is set up with nine choices and students have to do three that will form tic-tac-toe.  I have even seen teachers give extra credit if students do them all, or in Bingo terms, a 'cover all'.

As  stated,  Choice  Boards  can  also  be  used  to  fill  in  for  idle moments and review a variety of concepts that are being learned. Here is an example for older students:

| Create a Venn Diagram comparing yourself and a character in To Kill a Mockingbird      | Illustrate a book cover for a favorite book                                                                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create a comic strip with seven frames that shows how the Earth's surface has changed. | Complete the 'President Map' which shows the qualifications to be President, as well as the roles of the President.                                                                     |
| Create a game that will teach a concept from class, but requires movement              | Describe 10 occupations that incorporate area, surface area, or volume. Be very specific on the job title and explain how that job uses area, SA, or volume. At least 3 sentences each. |

Choice Boards give students some control over the activities they do,  yet  you  have  chosen  the  activities.   Always  be  open,  however, to  the  student  who  comes  to  you  with  an  idea  for  an  activity. Sometimes students have great ideas!

## K-W-L: Know, Want to know, Learned

- When beginning a unit of study, list all the things you KNOW about the topic.
- Next, create a list of things you WANT to know about this topic.
- After the unit of study is done, create a list of what has been LEARNED.

A K-W-L can be done as a class, or students can create their own. There are benefits to both and your learning goals will determine which one you may use.

Always remember ALL STUDENTS CAN LEARN!! However, what they learn, how they learn it, and the pace at which they learn it will vary. Under the differentiated instruction idea we are changing our instruction, our expectations, and our assessments based on the needs and interests of the students.

## 9. What is a Positive Classroom Environment?

JENNIFER BEASLEY AND MYRA HAULMARK

An excerpt from a professional journal kept by Kelvin Lee Seifer when teaching kindergarten:

November 14th: Today my student  Carol  sat  in  the  circle, watching  others  while  we  all played  Duck,  Duck,  Goose  (in this game, one student is outside

the  circle,  tags  another  student  who  then  chases  the  first  person around the circle). Carol's turn had already passed. Apparently, she was  bored  now,  because  she  flopped  on  her  back,  smiling  broadly, rolling  around  luxuriously  on  the  floor  in  the  path  of  the  other runners.  Several  classmates  noticed  her,  smiled  or  giggled,  began flopping  down  as  well.  One  chaser  tripped  over  a  'flopper.'Sit  up, Carol,'  said  I,  the  ever-vigilant  teacher.  'You're  in  the  way.'  But  no result.  I  repeated  twice  more,  firmly;  then  moved  to  pick  her  up. Instantly Carol ran to the far side of the gym, still smiling broadly. Then her best friend ran off with her. Now a whole new game was launched, or really two games: 'Run-from-the-teacher' and 'Enjoybeing-watched-by-everybody.'  A  lot  more  exciting,  unfortunately, than Duck, Duck, Goose!

An excerpt from Kelvin's same journal several years later, when he was teaching math in high school:

March 4th: The same four students sat in the back again today, as usual. They seem to look in every direction except at me, even when I'm explaining material that they need to know. The way they smile and  whisper  to  each  other,  it  seems  almost  like  they  are  'in  love'

with  each  other,  though  I  can't  be  sure  who  loves  whom  the  most. Others-students not part of the foursome-seem to react variously. Some seem annoyed, turn the other way, avoid talking with the group, and so on. But others seem almost envious-as if they want to be part of the 'in' group, too, and were impressed with the foursome's ability to  get  away  with  being  inattentive  and  almost  rude.  Either  way,  I think a lot of other students are being distracted. Twice during the period today, I happened to notice members of the group passing a note and then giggling and looking at me. By the end, I had had enough of this sort of thing, so I kept them in briefly after class and asked one of them to read the note. They looked a bit embarrassed and hesitant, but  eventually,  one  of  them  opened  the  note  and  read  it  out  loud. 'Choose one,' it said. 'Mr. Seifert looks 1) old \_\_\_\_, 2) stupid\_\_\_\_, or 3)clueless\_\_\_\_.'

Kelvin's experiences in managing these very different classrooms taught  him  what  every  teacher  knows  or  else  quickly  learns management  matters  a  lot.  But  his  experiences  also  taught  that management  is  about  more  than  correcting  the  misbehaviors  of individuals,  more  than  just  'discipline.'  Classroom  management  is also about 'orchestrating' or coordinating entire sets or sequences of learning activities so that everyone, misbehaving or not, learns as easily and productively as possible. Educators sometimes, therefore, describe good classroom management as the creation of a positive learning  environment,  because  the  term  calls  attention  to  the totality of activities and people in a classroom, as well as to their goals and expectations about learning (Jones &amp; Jones, 2007). When Kelvin  was  teaching,  he  used  both  terms  almost  interchangeably, though in speaking of management he more often was referring to individual  student's  behavior  and  learning,  and  in  using  the  term learning environment he more often meant the overall 'feel' of the class as a whole.

## Why Classroom Management Matters

Managing the learning environment is both a major responsibility and an ongoing concern for every teacher, even for those with years of  experience  (Good  &amp;  Brophy,  2002).  There  are  several  reasons. In the first place, a lot goes on in classrooms simultaneously, even when students seem to be doing only 'one' task together. Twentyfive students may all be working on a sheet of math problems, but look  more  closely:  several  may  be  stuck  on  a  particular  problem,

but each for different reasons. A few others have worked only the first problem or two and are now chatting quietly with each other instead of continuing. Still, others have finished and are wondering what to do next. At any one moment, each student needs something different-different  information,  different  hints,  different  kinds  of encouragement. The diversity increases even more if the teacher deliberately assigns multiple activities to different groups  or individuals  (for  example,  if  some  are  doing  a  reading  assignment while others do the math problems).

Another reason that managing the environment is challenging is because a teacher can never predict everything that will happen in a class. A well-planned lesson may fall flat on its face, or take less time than you expect, and you find yourself improvising to fill class time. On the other hand, an unplanned moment may become a wonderful, sustained exchange among students; so you have to drop previous plans  and  'go  with  the  flow'  of  their  discussion.  Interruptions happen continually: a fire drill, a quick drop-in visit from another teacher or from the principal, a call on the intercom from the office. An activity may turn out well, but also end up rather differently than you intended; you, therefore, have to decide how, if at all, to adjust the next day to allow for this surprise.

A third reason for the importance of management is that students form  opinions  and  perceptions  about  your  teaching  that  may coincide  neither  with  your  own  nor  with  other  students'.  What seems to you like the encouragement of a shy student may seem to  the  student  herself  like  'forced  participation.'  A  more  eager, outgoing classmate watching your special effort to encourage the shy  student,  however,  may  not  see  you  as  either  encouraging  or coercing,  but  as  overlooking  or  ignoring  other  students  who  are already more willing to participate. The variety of perceptions can lead  to  surprises  in  students'  responses  to  you-most  often  small ones, but occasionally more major.

At  the  broadest,  society-wide  level,  management  challenges teachers  because  public  schooling  is  not  voluntary,  and  students' presence  in  a  classroom  is  therefore  not  a  sign,  in  and  of  itself,

that  they  wish  to  be  there.  Students'  presence  is  instead  just  a sign  that  an  opportunity  exists  for  teachers  to  motivate  students to learn. Many students, of course, do enjoy learning and being in school-but not all. Others do enjoy school, but primarily because teachers  have  worked  hard  to  make  classroom  life  pleasant  and interesting. They become motivated because you have successfully created  a  positive  learning  environment  and  have  sustained  it through skillful management.

Fortunately, it is possible to earn this sort of commitment from students,  and  this  chapter  describes  some  ways  of  doing  so.  We begin with some ways of preventing management problems in the first place by increasing students' focus on learning. The methods include the arrangement of classroom space, the establishment of procedures, routines, and rules, and communicating the importance of learning both to students and to parents. After these preventionoriented discussions, we look at ways of refocusing students when and if  their  minds  or  actions  do  stray  from  the  tasks  at  hand.  As you probably know from your own experience as a student, bringing students  back  on  task  can  happen  in  many  ways,  ways  that  vary widely in the energy and persistence required of the teacher. We try to indicate some of this diversity, but because of space limitations and because of the richness of classroom life, we cannot describe them all.

## Preventing Management Problems

The  easiest  management  problems  to  solve  are  ones  that  do  not happen in the first place! You can help to prevent problems even before the first day of school by arranging classroom furniture and materials in ways that make learning as easy to focus on as possible. Later, during the first few days, you can establish procedures and rules that support a focus on learning even more.

## Arranging Classroom Space

Viewed  broadly,  it  may  be  tempting  to  think  that  classrooms  are arranged in similar ways, but there are actually important alternative  arrangements  to  consider.  Variations  happen  because of  grade  level,  the  subjects  taught,  the  teacher's  philosophy  of education,  and  of  course  the  size  of  the  room  and  the  furniture available.  Whatever  the  arrangement  that  you  choose,  it  should help students to focus on learning tasks as much as possible and minimize the chances of distractions. Beyond these basic principles, however, the 'best' arrangement depends on what your students need and on the kind of teaching that you prefer and feel able to provide  (Bothmer,  2003;  Nations  &amp;  Boyett,  2002).  Here  are  some ideas to help choose among your options. In considering them (and before moving too much furniture around your room!), you might want to try experimenting with spatial arrangements 'virtually' by using one of the computer programs available on the Internet.

## Displays and Wall Space

All classrooms have walls, of course, and how you fill or use them can affect the mood or feeling of a classroom. More displays make the room more interesting and can be used to reinforce curriculum goals  and  display  (and  hence  recognize)  students'  work.  But  too many  displays  can  also  make  a  room  seem  'busy'  or  distracting as  well  as  physically  smaller,  and  they  can  also  be  more  work  to maintain. If you are starting a new school year, then, there is usually a  need  to  decorate  some  of  the  wall  or  bulletin  board  space,  but no urgent need to fill it all. Leaving some open space can give the flexibility to respond to curriculum or learning needs that emerge after  the  year  is  underway.  The  same  advice  applies  to  displays that are especially high maintenance, such as aquariums, pets, and plants. These can serve wonderfully as learning aids, but do not have

to be in place on the first day of school. Not only the students but also you yourself may already have enough distractions to cope with at that time.

In  the  elementary  years,  we  tend  to  find  classrooms  filled  with displays.   The  walls  are  covered  and  sometimes  there  are  even things  hanging  from  the  ceiling.   All  of  these  things  will  draw students'  attention,  and  very  well  may  draw  their  attention  away from you and from their work.  There is too much to attend to and even  a  typically  developing  child  may  have  difficulty  deciding  on where to focus their attention.  For a child who may have any type of sensory concern or attention difficulty, they may now be extremely overwhelmed and have great difficulty 'paying attention' to what you want them to focus on.  Consider carefully in the elementary years how much you may decorate a classroom.

In  our  secondary  classrooms,  we  sometimes  see  the  opposite happen;  there  is  a  lack  of  color  and  visual  display.   As  with  our younger children, be sure you do not overwhelm the classroom, but be sure you try to add color and displays that support learning and will add to the overall comfort of the classroom.

## Computers in the Classroom

If you are like the majority of teachers, you may have one or more computers  in  your  classroom,  and  their  placement  may  be  predetermined by the location of power and cable outlets. If so, you need  to  think  about  computer  placement  early  in  the  process  of setting up a room. Once the location of computers is set, locations for  desks,  high-usage  shelves,  and  other  moveable  items  can  be chosen more sensibly-in general, so as to minimize distractions to students and to avoid unnecessary traffic congestion.

## Visibility of and Interactions with Students

Learning is facilitated  if  the  furniture  and  space  allow  you  to  see all students and to interact with them from a comfortable distance. Usually, this means that the main, central part of the room-where desks and tables are usually located-needs to be as open and as spacious as possible. While this idea may seem obvious, enacting it  can  sometimes  be  challenging  in  practice  if  the  room  itself  is small  or  unusually  shaped.  In  classrooms  with  young  students (kindergarten), furthermore, open spaces tend to allow, if not invite, movement of children that is longer and faster-a feature that you may consider either constructive or annoying, depending on your educational goals and the actual level of activity that occurs.

## Spatial Arrangements Unique To Grade Levels or Subjects

Some room arrangements depend significantly on the grade level or subject area of the class. If you teach in elementary school, for example,  you  may  need  to  think  about  where  students  can  keep their daily belongings, such as coats and lunches. In some schools, these  can  be  kept  outside  the  classroom-but  not  in  all  schools. Some  subjects  and  grade  levels,  furthermore,  lend  themselves especially well to small group interaction, in which case you might prefer not to seat students in rows, but around several small-group tables or work areas. The latter arrangement is sometimes preferred by elementary teachers, but is also useful in high schools wherever students need lots of counter space, as in some shops courses, or wherever they need to interact, as in English as Second Language courses  (McCafferty,  Jacobs,  &amp;  Iddings,  2006).  The  key  issue  in deciding between tables and rows, however, is not grade level or subject as such, but the amount of small group interaction you want to encourage, compared to the amount of whole-group instruction. As  a  rule,  tables  make  talking  with  peers  easier,  and  rows  make

listening to the teacher more likely, and group work slightly more awkward to arrange.

Keep in mind that not all of us function well in group settings. Grouping children in desk clusters, or at tables, may be productive for  some  of  our  students.   Others,  however,  may  work  more effectively if they sit alone.  Please consider offering both options to your students.  If a child wishes to sit on their own, allow them to do so.  If you are going to do any type of group work, you can easily assign them to a group of students for the activity.

Ironically,  some  teachers  experience  challenges  about  room arrangement  without  even  having  a  room  of  their  own,  because they must 'float' or move among other teachers' rooms. 'Floating' is especially likely among specialized teachers (e.g. music teachers in elementary schools, who move from class to class) and in schools that  are  short  on  classrooms  overall.  Floating  can  sometimes  be annoying to the teacher, though it actually also has advantages, such as not having to take responsibility for how other teachers' rooms are arranged). If you find yourself floating, it helps to consider a few key strategies, such as:

- consider using a permanent cart to move crucial supplies from room to room;
- make sure that every one of your rooms has an overhead projector (do not count on using chalkboards in other teachers' rooms);
- talk to the other teachers about having at least one shelf or corner in each room designated for your exclusive use.

## Establishing Daily Procedures and Routines

Procedures  or  routines are  specific  ways  of  doing  common, repeated classroom tasks or activities. Examples include checking daily attendance, dealing with students who arrive late, or allowing

students  to  use  the  bathroom  during  class  or  go  to  their  lockers to get materials that they forgot to bring. Procedures also include ways of turning in or retrieving daily homework (e.g. putting it on a designated shelf at a particular time), or of gaining the teacher's attention during quiet seatwork (e.g. raising your hand and waiting), or of choosing and starting a 'free choice' activity after completing a classroom assignment.

Procedures serve the largely practical purpose of making activities  and  tasks  flow  smoothly  and  efficiently-a  valuable  and necessary purpose in classrooms, where the actions of many people have  to  be  coordinated  within  limited  amounts  of  time.  As  such, procedures are more like social conventions than moral expectations. They are not primarily about what is ethically right or ethically desirable to do (Turiel, 2006). Most procedures or routines can  be  accomplished  in  more  than  one  way,  with  only  minor differences in success at the outcomes. There is more than one way, for  example,  for  the  procedure  of  taking  attendance:  the  teacher could call the roll, delegate a student to call the roll, or simply note students' presence on a seating chart. Each variation accomplishes essentially the same task, and the choice among them may therefore be less important than the fact that the class coordinates its actions somehow, by committing to some sort of choice.

For teachers, of course, an initial task is to establish procedures and routines in the first place. Because of the conventional quality of  procedures,  some  teachers  find  that  it  works  well  simply  to announce  and  explain  key  procedures  without  inviting  much discussion from students ('Here is how we will choose partners for the  group  work').  Other  teachers,  however,  prefer  to  invite  input from students when creating procedures (asking 'What do you feel is  the  best  way  for  students  to  get  my  attention  during  a  quiet reading  time?').  Both  approaches  have  advantages  as  well  as disadvantages. Simply announcing key procedures saves time and ensures consistency in case you are teaching more than one class (as you would in high school), but it creates a bigger responsibility to choose procedures that are truly reasonable and practical. On the

other  hand,  inviting  students'  input  can  help  students  to  become aware of and committed to procedures, but at the cost of taking more time to establish them, and at the risk of creating confusion if  you  teach  multiple  classes,  each  of  which  adopts  different procedures. Whatever approach you choose, you and the students of course have to take into account the procedures or rules imposed by  the  school  or  school  district  as  a  whole.  A  school  may  have  a uniform policy or expectation about how to record daily attendance, for  example,  and  that  policy  may  determine,  either  partly  or completely, how you take attendance with your particular students.

## Establishing Classroom Rules

Unlike procedures or routines, rules express standards of behavior for which individual students need to take responsibility. Although they  may  help  in  ensuring  the  practical  efficiency  of  classroom tasks, they are really about encouraging students to be personally responsible  for  learning,  as  well  as  for  behaving  decently  and respectfully with each other.

Most  educational  experts  recommend  keeping  the  number  of rules  to  a  minimum  in  order  to  make  them  easier  to  remember (Thorson,  2003;  Brophy,  2003).  Another  feature  is  that  they  are stated in positive terms ('Do X…') rather than negative terms ('Do not do Y…'), a strategy that emphasizes and clarifies what students should do rather than what they should avoid. A third feature is that each  rule  actually  covers  a  collection  of  more  specific  behaviors. The rule 'Bring all materials to class,' for example, potentially covers bringing pencils, paper, textbooks, homework papers, and permission slips-depending on the situation. As a result of being stated somewhat generally, rules contain a degree of ambiguity that sometimes requires interpretation.  Infractions  may  occur,  that  is, that are marginal or 'in a grey area,' rather than clearcut. A student may bring a pen, for example, but the pen may not work properly,

and  you  may  therefore  wonder  whether  this  incident  is  really  a failure  to  follow  the  rule  or  just  an  unfortunate  (and  in  this  case minor)  fault  of  the  pen  manufacturer.   For  myself,  it  is  not  the student's  fault  if  the  pen  fails  to  work.   They  have  fulfilled  the requirement of 'bringing materials to class'.  (As a side note, always have  extra  pens  and  pencils  available  for  students  for  just  such incidents.)

As  with  classroom  procedures,  rules  can  be  planned  either  by the  teacher  alone  or  by  the  teacher  with  advice  from  students. The arguments for each approach are similar to the arguments for procedures: rules 'laid on' by the teacher are quicker and easier to present to students,  but rules influenced by the students may be supported more fully by the students. Because rules focus strongly on  personal  responsibility,  however,  there  is  a  stronger  case  for involving  students  in  making  classroom  rules  than  in  making classroom procedures (Brookfield, 2006; Kohn, 2006). In any case, the  question  of  who  plans  classroom  rules  is  not  necessarily  an either/or choice. It is possible in principle to impose certain rules on students (for example, 'Always be polite to each other') but let the students determine the consequences for violations of certain rules (for example, 'If a student is discourteous to a classmate, he/ she  must  apologize  to  the  student  in  writing').  Some  mixture  of influences is probably inevitable, in fact, if only because of your own moral commitments as a teacher and because the school itself is likely  to  have  rules  of  its  own  (like  'No  smoking in the school' or 'Always walk in the hallways'). A classroom set of rules therefore might  need  to  refer  to  and  honor  this  broader  source  of  rules somehow, if only by including a classroom rule stating something like 'Obey all school rules.'

School-age  children  are  in  the  stage  where  they  need  to  have control over their world and make real-world decisions.  Allowing them to make the classroom rules meets those emotional needs. Students  will  also  follow  the  guidelines  and  support  each  other more when they have created them. The following comes from an example by an elementary classroom teacher:

'In  my  classrooms,  on  the  first  day,  we  talked  about  being together  for  the  year  and  we  had  to  set  some  guidelines  for  our behavior  to  help  everyone  learn  and  stay  safe.   I  would  ask  them what types of things we needed to do in order for everyone to stay safe, keep our materials safe, and learn.

I asked the children to give me their ideas and I wrote them on the  board.   Any  idea  was  acceptable  in  this  stage,  even  if  it  was something I didn't want to see as a guideline. Once we had all of the ideas, we then reviewed each of them.  We asked three questions:

1. Will this guideline keep us safe?
2. Will this guideline keep our materials from being broken, destroyed, etc.?
3. Will this guideline help us learn?

If  we  answered 'No' to any of these questions, we eliminated the idea.   What  was  left  we  used  as  our  guidelines.   Sometimes  we needed to re-word the statement, or I suggested an addition to it. Understand that ultimately you have the final decision, but you will be surprised at what students are able to devise on their own.  Our guidelines were also fluid.  If we found a need down the road for a new guideline, we added it to our list.

Once we had our statements, I wrote them on a large piece of paper  with  the  heading,  'Staying  Safe  and  Loving  to  Learn:   Our Class Guidelines', and then each student signed the paper.  I signed it  also  as  I  was  a  part  of  the  learning  environment  and  I  was expected to follow the same guidelines.  We hung this in the room for  all  to  see.   Over  time,  you  will  find  students  referring  to  this document and guiding their classmates' inappropriate behaviors.'

Teachers  can  co-create  guidelines  described  earlier  to  help develop  positive  social  skills,  as  well  as  positive  and  effective learning skills; they are not grounds for punishment.  If the guideline is  to  'Respect everyone we come in contact with,' then a student who is disrespectful should not be punished.  A teacher would need to  talk  with  the  student  and  let  him/her  know  how  their  words

or actions were not respectful; talk about what should have been said or done, and then allow the student to make the decision to apologize, or have them ask the person who was 'wronged' what they  can  do  to  make  the  situation  better.   Handling  this  incident in this manner requires the student to take responsibility for their actions and  learn how  to  display the appropriate behaviors; punishment does not do this.

Pacing and Structuring Lessons and Activities

One  of  the  best  ways  to  prevent  management  problems  is  by pacing  and  structuring  lessons  or  activities  as  smoothly  and continuously as possible. Reaching this goal depends on three major strategies:

- selecting tasks or activities at an appropriate level of difficulty for your students.  (This means there may be multiple activities to meet the varying abilities of your students.)
- providing a moderate level of structure or clarity to students about what they are supposed to do, especially during transitions between activities, and
- keeping alert to the flow and interplay of behaviors for the class as a whole and for individuals within it.

Each  of  these  strategies  presents  its  own  special  challenges  to teachers,  but  also  its  own  opportunities  for  helping  students  to learn.

## Choosing Tasks at an Appropriate Level of Difficulty

As  experienced  teachers  know  and  as  research  has  confirmed, students  are  most  likely  to  engage  with  learning  when  tasks  are of moderate difficulty, neither too easy nor too hard and therefore neither boring nor frustrating (Britt, 2005). Finding the right level of difficulty, however, can sometimes be a challenge if you have little experience  in  teaching  a  particular  grade  level  or  curriculum,  or

even if  a  class  is  simply  new  to  you  and  in  this  sense  'unknown.' Whether  familiar  to  you  or  not,  members  of  any  class  are  likely to  have  diverse  abilities  and  readiness,  and  this  fact  alone  makes it  harder  to  determine  what  level  of  difficulty  is  appropriate.  A common  strategy  for  dealing  with  these  ambiguities  is  to  begin units,  lessons,  or  projects  with  tasks  or  content  that  is  relatively easy  and  familiar,  and  then  gradually  introduce  more  difficult material or tasks until students seem challenged, but not overwhelmed.  Using  this  strategy  gives  the  teacher  a  chance  to observe  and  diagnose  students'  learning  needs  before  adjusting content, and gives students a chance to orient themselves to the teacher's  expectations  and  the  topic  of  study  without  becoming stressed  or  frustrated  prematurely.  Later  in  a  unit,  lesson,  or project,  students  are  then  in  a  better  position  to  deal  with  more difficult  tasks  or  content  (Van  Merrionboer,  2003).  The  principle seems  to  help  even  with  'authentic'  learning  projects-ones  that resemble real-world activities of students (such as learning to drive an  automobile),  and  that  present  a  variety  of  complex  tasks simultaneously.  Even  in  those  cases,  it  helps  for  the  teacher  to isolate and focus on the simplest subtasks first (such as 'put the key in the ignition') and only move to harder tasks later (such as parallel parking).

Sequencing  instruction  is  only  a  partial  solution  to  finding  the best 'level' of instruction because it still does not deal with lasting differences  among  students  as  individuals.  The  core  challenge  to teachers is to fully individualize or differentiate instruction: to tailor instruction or activities not only to the class as a group but to the differences  among  members  of  the  class?  One  way  to  approach this problem is to plan different content or activities for different students  or  groups  of  students.  While  one  group  works  on  Task A,  another group works on Task B; one group works on relatively easy math problems, for example, while another works on harder ones. Taken very far, managing multiple activities or tasks obviously complicates a teacher's job, but it can and has been done by many teachers (and it also can make teaching more interesting!).

## Providing Moderate Amounts of Structure and Detail

Chances are that at some point in your educational career you have asked,  or  at  least  wished,  that  a  teacher  would  clarify  or  explain an  assignment  more  fully,  and  thereby  give  it  more  structure  or organization.  Students'  need  and  desire  for  clarity  is  especially common  with  assignments  that  are  by  nature  open-ended,  such as long essays, large projects, or creative works. Simply being told to  'write  an  essay  critiquing  the  novel,'  for  example,  leaves  more room for uncertainty (and worry) than being given guidelines about what the essay should contain, what topics or parts it should have, and its appropriate length or style (Chesebro, 2003). Students' need for  structure  and  clarity  varies,  furthermore,  not  only  among assignments  but  among  students  as  individuals.  Some  students desire  it  more  than  others  and  perform  especially  well  when provided with relatively more structure and clarity. Students with certain kinds of learning difficulties, in particular, often learn more effectively and stay on task more if provided with somewhat more explicit  or  detailed  instructions  about  the  specific  tasks  expected for assignments (Marks, 2003).

As  a  teacher,  the  challenge  is  to  accommodate  students'  need for  clarity  without  making  guidance  so  specific  or  detailed  that students  have  little  room  to  think  for  themselves.  Carried  to  a (ridiculous) extreme,  for example,  a teacher can give 'clear' instructions  for  an  essay  by  announcing  not  only  exactly  which articles to read and cite in preparing for the essay and which topics or  issues  to  cover,  but  even  the  wording  of  the  key  sentences  in their essays. This much specificity may reduce students' uncertainties and make the teacher's task of evaluating the essays relatively  straightforward  and  easy.  But  it  also  reduces  or  even eliminates  the  educational  value  of  the  assignment-assuming,  of course, that its purpose is to get students to think for themselves.

Ideally,  then,  the  structure  should  be  moderate  rather  than extreme. There should be just enough to give students some sense of  direction  and  to  stimulate  more  accomplishment  than  if  they

worked  with  less  structure  or  guidance.  This  ideal  is  essentially Vygotsky's  idea  of  the  'Zone  of  Proximal  Development':  a  place (figuratively speaking) where students get more done with help than without it. The ideal amount of guidance-and the 'location' of the Zone of Proximal Development-may vary with the assignment and with the student, and it may (hopefully) decrease over time for all students. One student may need more guidance to do his or her best in math, but less guidance in order to write his best essay. Another student may need the reverse. Both students may need less at the end of the year than at the beginning.

## Managing Transitions

The time between activities is often full of distractions and 'lost' time, and is often when inappropriate behaviors are especially likely to  occur.  Part  of  the  problem  is  intrinsic  to  transitions:  students often have to wait before a new activity begins, and therefore get bored, at the same moment when the teacher may be preoccupied with  locating  and  arranging  materials  for  the  new  activity.  From the  point  of  view  of  students,  therefore,  transitions  may  seem essentially like unsupervised group time, when (seemingly) 'anything goes.'

Minimizing such problems requires two strategies, one of which is easier to implement than the other. The easier strategy is for you, as a teacher, to organize materials as well as possible ahead of time so  that  you  minimize  the  time  needed  to  begin  a  new  activity  or class session. This advice sounds simple, and mostly is, but it can sometimes take a bit of practice to implement smoothly.

A second, more complex strategy, is to teach students as many ways as possible to manage their own behavior during transitions (Marzano &amp; Marzano, 2004).[5] If students talk too loudly between activities,  for  example,  then  discuss  with  them  what  constitutes appropriate  levels  or  amounts  of  talk  during  those  times,  as  well as  about  the  need  for  them  to  monitor  their  own  sound  level  at

that  time.  Or  if  students  stop  work  early  in  anticipation  of  the end of an activity, then talk about-or even practice-using a signal from  yourself  to  indicate  the  true  ending  point  for  an  activity.  If certain  students  continue  working  beyond  the  end  of  an  activity, on  the  other  hand,  then  try  giving  students  advance  warning  of the  impending  end  of  the  activity,  and  remind  them  about  their taking the responsibility for actually finishing work once they hear the  advance warning. And so on. The point of all of these tactics is to encourage students' sense of responsibility for their behavior transitions and thereby reduce your own need to monitor them at that crucial time.

None of these ideas, of course, mean that you, as a teacher, can or should give up monitoring students' behavior entirely. Chances are that you still will need to notice if and when someone talks too loudly,  finishes  too  early,  or  continues  too  long,  and  you  will  still need to give those students appropriate reminders. But the amount of reminding will be less to the extent that students can remind and monitor themselves-a welcome trend at any time during the day, but especially during transitions.

## Maintaining the Flow of Activities

A  lot  of  classroom  management  is  really  about  keeping  activities flowing  smoothly,  both  during  individual  lessons  and  across  the school  day.  The  trouble  with  this  straightforward-sounding  idea, however, is that there is never just 'one' event happening at a time, even if only one activity has been formally planned and is supposed to be occurring. Even if, for example, everyone is supposed to be attending  a  single  whole-class  discussion  on  a  topic,  individual students will be having different experiences at any one moment. Several students may be listening and contributing comments, for example, but a few others may be planning what they want to say next and ignoring the current speakers, still, others may ruminating about what a previous speaker said, and still others may be thinking

about  unrelated  matters,  like  using  the  restroom,  food,  or  after school  events.  Things  get  even  more  complicated  if  the  teacher deliberately  plans  multiple  activities:  in  that  case,  some  students may interact with the teacher, for example, while others do work in an unsupervised group or work independently in a different part of the room. How is a teacher keep activities flowing smoothly in the face of such variety?

A common mistake of beginning teachers in multi-faceted activity settings like these is to pay too much attention to anyone activity, student, or small group, at the expense of noticing and responding to  all  the  others.  If  you  are  helping  a  student  on  one  side  of  the room but someone on the other side disturbs classmates with the off-task conversation, it tends to be less effective either to finish with the student you are helping before attending to the disruption or to interrupt your help for the student until you have solved the disruption on the other side of the room. Either approach is likely to allow the flow of activities to be disrupted somewhere; there is a risk that either the student's chatting may spread to others, or the interrupted student may become bored with waiting to regain the teacher's attention and get off-task herself.

A better solution, though  at first, it may  seem  tricky or challenging,  is  to  attend  to  both  events  at  once-a  strategy  that was named 'Withitness' in a series of now-classic research students several decades ago (Kounin, 1970). 'Withitness' does not mean that you focus on all simultaneous activities with equal care, but only that you are aware of multiple activities, behaviors, and events to some  degree.  At  a  particular  moment,  for  example,  you  may  be focusing on helping a student, but in some corner of your mind, you also notice when chatting begins on the other side of the room. You have, as the saying goes, 'eyes in the back of your head.' Research has found that experienced teachers are much more likely to show 'withitness'  than  inexperienced  teachers  and  that  these  qualities are associated with their managing classrooms successfully (Emmer &amp; Stough, 2001).

Simultaneous awareness makes possible responses to the

multiple events that are immediate and nearly simultaneous-what educators sometimes call 'overlapping'. The teacher's responses to each event or behavior need not take equal time, nor even be equally noticeable to all students. If you are helping one student with seat work at the precise moment when another student begins chatting off-task, for example, a quick glance to the second student may be enough to bring him back to the work at hand, and may scarcely interrupt your conversation with the first student, or be noticed by others who are not even involved. The result is a smoother flow to activities overall.

## Communicating the Importance of Learning and of Positive Behavior

Taken together, arranging space, establishing procedures and rules, and  developing  'withitness'  about  multiple  events  set  the  stage for  communicating  an  important  message:  that  a  classroom  is  a place  where  learning  and  positive  social  behavior  are  priorities. In  addition,  teachers  can  convey this message by giving feedback to  students  in  a  timely  way,  by  keeping  accurate  records  of  their performance, and by deliberately communicating with parents or caregivers about their children and about activities in class.

## Giving Timely Feedback

Feedback is a term often used by educators to refer to responses given to students about their behavior or performance. Feedback is essential for students if they are to learn or if they are to develop classroom behavior that is  new  or  more  subtle  and  'mature.'  But feedback can only be fully effective if received as soon as possible when  it  is  still  relevant  to  the  task  or  activity  at  hand  which  is usually as soon as possible (Reynolds, 1992).[8] A score on a test is

more informative immediately after a test than after a six-month delay, when students may have forgotten much of the content of the test. A teacher's comment to a student about an inappropriate, offtask behavior may not be especially welcome immediately after the behavior occurs, but it can be more influential and informative than later when both teacher and student have trouble remembering the context of the off-task behavior, and in this sense may literally 'not know what they are talking about.' The same is true for comments about a positive behavior by a student: hearing a compliment right away makes it easier to connect the comment with the behavior, and allows the compliment to influence the student more strongly. Even  though  there  are  of  course  practical  limits  to  how  fast feedback can be given, the general principle is clear: feedback tends to work better when it is timely.

When it comes to feedback in regards to behavior,  we  have  to engage students in conversations about what took place and how they  can  display  more  positive  behaviors  in  the  future.   Students need this type of support and feedback if we want them to change their actions.  Punishing them is not feedback and it is not effective in changing behaviors.

Students also need feedback when it comes to the work they do in  the  classroom.  We have all had teachers who collect work but don't return it for two or three weeks.  By that point, students are no longer vested in the assignment and they are not going to learn from any comments or feedback you are given, assuming feedback is given.

If  we  ask  students  to  complete  an  assignment,  project,  etc.,  we need  to  be  sure  we  not  only  return  it  timely  but  also  provide feedback.  Let students know where they were strong, things you may  have  liked  about  the  assignment,  as  well  as  how  they  can improve in areas.   Feedback  should  be  specific  and  help  students learn.  Comments such as 'Good Job', 'Nice Work', or 'Needs More Detail', do not give students the information they need in order to improve  or  continue  a  positive  strategy,  etc.   They  have  to  know what was 'good' or 'nice.'  You can use these terms, but you need

to give them the information that warrants this statement.  Here are some examples:

1. You have two more words correct on your spelling test than last week.  Good job!
2. All of your colors complement each other in your drawing and the faces are realistic and express emotion.  Nice work!
3. There is more detail needed in your paper on arson.  You could have included the reasons why people resort to arson, and what types of help is available for serial arsonists.

Can you see how these statements provide the student with more information  that  they  can  use  as  they  move  forward  in  their studies?  This is the type of feedback we need to give to students. When  we  provide  this  for  them  and  return  their  work  with  this feedback in a timely manner, we can provide valuable and strong support for their continued learning.

During  the  days  or  weeks,  while  students  wait  for  a  test  or assignment to be returned, they are left without information about the quality or nature of their performance; at the extreme, they may even have to complete the next test or assignment before getting any  information  from  an  earlier  one.  (Perhaps  you  have  already experienced this problem during your years as a student!)

## Maintaining Accurate Records

Accurate records are helpful not only for scores on tests, quizzes or assignments but also for keeping descriptive information about the nature of students' academic skills or progress. A common way to do so is the student portfolio, which is a compilation of the student's work  and  ongoing  assessments  of  it  added  by  the  teacher  or  by the student (Moritz &amp; Christie, 2005; White, 2005). To know how a student's science project evolved from its beginning, for example, a  teacher  and  student  can  keep  a  portfolio  of  lab  notes,  logs,

preliminary  data,  and  the  like.  To  know  how  a  student's  writing skills are developing, on the other hand, they could keep a portfolio of early drafts  on  various  writing  assignments.  As  the  work accumulates, the student can discuss it with the teacher, and either of them can write brief reflections on its strengths thus far and on the  next  steps  needed  to  improve  the  work  further.  By  providing a way to respond to work as it evolves, portfolios can respond to students' work relatively promptly, and in any case sooner than if a teacher waited until the work was complete or final.

## Communicating with Parents and Caregivers

Teachers are responsible for keeping parents informed and involved to whatever extent is practical. Virtually all parents understand and assume  that  schools  are  generally  intended  for  learning,  but communication can enrich their understanding of how this purpose is  realized  in  their  particular  child's  classroom,  and  it  can  show them more precisely what their particular child is doing there. Such understanding  in  turn  allows  parents  and  caregivers  to  support their  child's  learning  more  confidently  and  'intelligently,'  and  in this  sense  contributes,  at  least  indirectly,  to  a  positive  learning environment in their child's class.

There are various ways to communicate with parents, each with advantages and limitations. Here are three common examples:

- A regular classroom newsletter: The advantage of a newsletter is that it establishes a link with all parents or caregivers with comparatively little effort on the part of the teacher.  At the beginning of the year, for example, a newsletter can tell about special materials that students will need, important dates to remember (like professional development days when there is no school), or about curriculum plans for the next few weeks. But newsletters also have limitations. They can seem impersonal, for example, or they may get lost on the way home and never reach parents or caregivers. They can also be impractical for teachers with multiple classes, as in high school or in specialist subjects (like music or physical education), where each class may follow a different program or have a different purpose.  Email may allow us to send electronic copies of a newsletter, but either way, there is no guarantee parents will ready them.
- Telephone calls: The main advantage of phoning is its immediacy and individuality. Teacher and parent or caregiver can talk about a particular student, behavior, or concern. By the same token, however, phone calls are not an efficient way to inform parents about events or activities that affect everyone in common. The individuality of phoning may explain why teachers tend to use this method more often when a student has a problem that is urgent or unusual-as when he has failed a test or has misbehaved seriously. Rightly or wrongly, a student's successes may not seem urgent enough to merit a call to the student's home, although I would encourage you to make positive phone calls to parents as well.
- Parent-teacher conferences: Most schools schedule regular times-often a day or an evening-when teachers meet briefly with any parents or caregivers who request a meeting. Under good conditions, the conferences can have the individuality of phone calls, but also the greater richness of communication possible in face-to-face meetings. Since conferences are available to all parents, they need not focus on behavior or

academic problems, but often simply help to build rapport and understanding between parents or caregivers and the teacher. Sometimes too, particularly at younger grade levels, teachers organize conferences to be led by the student, who displays and explains his or her work using a portfolio or other archive of accumulated materials (Benson &amp; Barnett, 2005; Stiggins &amp; Chappuis, 2005). In spite of all of these advantages, though, parent-teacher conferences have limitations. Some parents have trouble getting to conferences, for example, because of their work schedules. Others may feel intimidated by any school-sponsored event because they speak limited English or because they remember getting along poorly in school themselves as children.

- Classroom Website:  A classroom website can help keep parents informed of classroom events, school information, and serve as a reference for class guidelines, expectations or other relevant information for families.

Even if a teacher makes all of these efforts to communicate, some parents may remain out of contact. In these cases it is important to  remember that the causes may not be parents' indifference to their child or to the value of education. Other possibilities exist, as some of our comments above indicate: parents may have difficulties with child care, for example, have inconvenient work schedules, or feel  self-conscious  because  of  their  own  limited  skills  (Stevens  &amp; Tollafield, 2003). Whatever the reasons, there are ways to encourage parents who may be shy, hesitant, or busy. One is to think of how they can assist the class or school even from home-for example, by making materials to be used in class or (if they are comfortable using English) phoning other parents about class events. A second way  is  to  have  a  specific  task  for  the  parents  in  mind-one  with clear  structure,  definite  starting  and  ending  points,  and  one  that truly  will  benefit  the  class  if  someone  can  in  fact  complete  it.  A third  is  to  encourage,  support,  and  respect  the  parents'  presence and contributions when they do show up at school functions. Keep

in mind, after all, that parents are experts about their own particular children, and without their efforts, you would have no students to teach!

## Responding to Student Misbehavior

So far we have focused on preventing behaviors that are off-task, inappropriate, or annoying. Our advice has all been pro-active or forward-looking:  plan  the  classroom  space  thoughtfully,  create reasonable procedures  and  rules, pace lessons and  activities appropriately, and communicate the importance of learning clearly. Although  we  consider  these  ideas  to  be  important,  it  would  be naïve to imply they are enough to prevent all behavior problems. For various reasons, students sometimes still do things that disrupt other students or interrupt the flow of activities. At such moments the  challenge  is  not  about  long-term  planning  but  about  making

appropriate, but prompt responses. Misbehaviors left alone can be contagious,  a  process  educators  sometimes  call  the  ripple  effect (Kounin,  1970).  Chatting  between  two  students,  for  example,  can gradually become chatting among six students; rudeness by one can eventually become rudeness by several; and so on. Because of this tendency, delaying a response to inappropriate behavior can make the job of getting students back on track harder than responding to it as immediately as possible.

There are many ways to respond to inappropriate behaviors, of course, and they vary in how much they focus on the immediate behavior  of  a  student  rather  than  on  longer-term  patterns  of behavior. There are so many ways to respond, in fact, that we can only describe a sampling of the possibilities here. None are effective all of the time, though all do work at least some of the time. We start with a response that may not seem on the surface like a remedy at all-simply ignoring misbehaviors.

## Ignoring Misbehaviors

A lot of misbehaviors are not important enough or frequent enough to deserve any response from the teacher at all. They are likely to disappear (or extinguish, in behaviorist terms) if simply left alone. If a student who is usually quiet during class happens to whisper to a neighbor once in a while, it is probably simpler, less disruptive, and just  as  effective  to  ignore  this  rare  infraction  of  a  classroom  rule. Some misbehaviors may not be worth a response even if they are frequent, as long as they do not seem to bother others. Suppose, for  example,  that  a  certain  student  has  a  habit  of  choosing  quiet seatwork times to sharpen her pencil, yet this behavior is not really noticed by others. Is it then really a problem, however unnecessary or ill-timed it may be? In both examples ignoring the behavior may be wise because there is little danger of the behavior spreading to other  students  or  of  becoming  even  more  frequent.  Interrupting

your activities-or the students'-might cause more disruption than simply ignoring the problem.

That  said,  there  can  sometimes  still  be  problems  in  deciding whether  particular  misbehavior  is  indeed  minor,  infrequent,  or unnoticed by others. Unlike in our example above, a student may whisper more than 'rarely' but less than 'often': in that case, when do you decide that the whispering is in fact too frequent and needs a  more  active  response  from  you?  Or  that  student  who  taps  her pencil, whom we mentioned above, may not bother most others, but she may nonetheless bother a few. In that case how many bothered classmates are 'too many'-five, three, just one, or…? In these grey, ambiguous cases, you may need a more active way of dealing with inappropriate behavior like the ones described in the next sections.

## Gesturing Non-verbally

Sometimes it works to communicate using gestures, eye contact, or  'body  language'  that  involve  little  or  no  speaking.  Nonverbal cues are often appropriate if misbehavior is just a bit too serious or frequent to ignore, but not serious or frequent enough to merit taking the time deliberately to speak to or talk with the student. If two students are chatting off-task for a relatively extended time, for example, sometimes a glance in their direction, a frown, or even just moving closer to the students is enough of a reminder to get them back on task. And even if these responses prove not to be enough, they may help to keep the off-task behavior from spreading to other students.

A  risk  of  relying  on  nonverbal  cues,  however,  is  that  some students may not understand their meaning, or even notice them. If the two chatting students mentioned above are too engrossed in their talking, for example, they may not see you glance or frown at them. Or they might notice but not interpret your cue as a reminder to  get  back  on  task.  Misinterpretation  of  nonverbal  gestures  and

cues is a little more likely with young children, who are still learning the  subtleties  of  adults'  nonverbal  'language'  (Guerrero  &amp;  Floyd, 2005; Heimann, et al., 2006). It can also be more likely with students who speak limited English and whose cultural background differs significantly different from yours, because the students may be used to communicating non-verbally in ways that literally 'look different' from the ways familiar to you (Marsh, Elfenbein, &amp; Ambady, 2003).

I  taught  my  students  some  basic  sign  language  to  assist  with these types of situations.  I taught them the sign for 'bathroom' so they  could  simply  sign  and  I  could  answer  and  we  avoided  some of  those  dramatic interruptions we have when someone needs to use the restroom.  I also taught them, 'yes', 'no', 'sit down', 'please', 'thank you', 'quiet', 'work', and a few others.  This allowed me to communicate with students in a way that did not disrupt class, and also gave them a way to communicate with me.

## Natural and Logical Consequences

Consequences  are  the  outcomes  or  results  of  an  action.  When managing  a  classroom,  two  kinds  of  consequences  are  especially effective,  at  least  when  the  conditions  are  appropriate:  natural consequences and logical consequences. Natural consequences are ones  that  happen  'naturally'  or  without  any  deliberate  intention by  anyone.  If  a  student  is  late  for  class,  for  example,  a  natural consequence is that he may miss information or material that he needs  to  do  an  assignment.  Logical  consequences  are  ones  that happen because of the responses of others, but that also have an obvious or 'logical' relationship to the original action. If one student steals  another's  lunch,  for  example,  a  logical  consequence  might be for the thief to reimburse the victim for the cost of the lunch. Natural  and  logical  consequences  are  often  woven  together  and thus hard to distinguish: if one student picks a fight with another student, a natural consequence might be injury to the aggressor (a

natural risk of fighting), but a logical consequence might be to lose friends  (the  response  of  others  to  fighting).  In  practice  both  may occur.

General research has found that natural and logical consequences can  be  effective  for  minimizing  undesirable  behaviors,  provided they  are  applied  in  appropriate  situations  (Weinstein,  TomlinsonClarke,  &amp;  Curran,  2004).  Take,  for  example,  a  student  who  runs impulsively down school hallways. By the very nature of this action, he  or  she  is  especially  likely  to  have  'traffic  accidents,'  and  thus (hopefully)  to  see  that  running  is  not  safe  and  to  reduce  the frequency  of  running.   Consider  a  student  who  chronically  talks during class instead of working on a class-time assignment. A logical outcome of this  choice  is  to  require  the  student  to  make  up  the assignment later, possibly as homework. Because the behavior and the  consequence  are  connected  directly,  the  student  is  relatively likely to see the drawback of choosing to talk, and to reduce how much he or she talks on subsequent occasions. In both cases, the key features that make natural and logical consequences work is:

1. they are appropriate to the misbehavior and
2. the student sees or understands the connection between the consequences and the original behavior.

Natural and logical consequences do not work for every problem behavior; if they did, there would be no further need for management  strategies!  One  limitation  is  that  misbehaviors  can sometimes  be  so  serious  that  no  natural  or  logical  consequence seems  sufficient  or  appropriate.  Suppose,  for  example,  that  one student deliberately breaks another student's eyeglasses. There may be a natural consequence for the victim (he or she will not be able to see easily), but not for a student who broke the glasses. There may also be no logical consequences for the aggressor that are fully satisfactory: the misbehaving student will not be able to repair the broken glasses and may not even be able to pay for new glasses for the victim.

Another  limitation  of  natural  and  logical  consequences  is  that their success depends on the motives of the misbehaving student. If the student is seeking attention or acceptance by others, then the consequences often work well. Bullying in order to impress others, for example, is more likely to lose friends than to win them-so this sort of bullying is to some extent self-limiting. If a student is seeking power over others, on the other hand, then consequences may not work well. Bullying in order to control others' actions, for example, may actually achieve its own goal, and its 'natural' results (losing friends)  would  not  affect  it.  Of  course,  students  may  sometimes act from combinations of motives, with the result that natural and logical consequences may succeed, but only partially.

The third problem with natural and logical consequences is that they  can  easily  be  confused  with  deliberate  punishment  (Kohn, 2006). The difference is important. Consequences are focused on repairing  damage  and  restoring  relationships,  and  in  this  sense, consequences  focus  on  the  future.  Punishments,  in  contrast, highlight the mistake or wrongdoing and in this sense focus on the past. Consequences tend to be more solution-focused; punishments tend to highlight the person who committed the act and to shame or humiliate the wrongdoer.

Classroom examples of the differences are plentiful. If a student is late for class, then a consequence may be that he or she misses important  information,  but  punishment  may  be  that  the  teacher scolds or reprimands the student. If a student speaks rudely to the teacher, a consequence may be that the teacher does not respond to the comment, or simply reminds the student to speak courteously. A  punishment  may  be  that  the  teacher  scolds  the  student  in  the presence of other students, or even imposes detention ('Stay after school for 15 minutes').

We want to strive to resolve issues with students using natural and logical consequences and avoid punishment.  Punishment does not teach, it is often not connected to the actual act, and it serves to cause hard feelings on the part of the student towards the teacher

and this does not help to foster a positive and productive teacher/ student relationship, which we know is vital in learning.

In  elementary  school,  taking  away  recess  is  often  used  as  a punishment  for  a  wide  variety  of  behaviors.   Taking  away  recess, however,  usually  never  relates  to  the  behavior  of  the  student!   I beg you never to use this punishment with your students.  First of all, it does nothing to teach appropriate behaviors, and that is our goal.  Recess provides a valuable learning opportunity for students. Students learn social skills such as problem-solving, how to enter play,  compromise,  and  many  more  through  interaction  on  the playground.  We also know that movement is vital in learning and children need the opportunity to move about and activate areas of the brain that may have 'gone to sleep', as children spend extended time sitting  at  a  desk.   There  is  also  the  motor  development  that takes  place  as  they  jump,  climb,  throw  a  ball  and  all  of  the  other activities they engage in.  While it's often used, and is an easy 'out' for  teachers,  talk  with  students  about  behaviors  and  look  to  give them positive strategies to follow rather than punishment for what they have done.  They need recess!

## Conflict Resolution and Problem Solving

When a student misbehaves persistently and disruptively, you will need strategies  that  are  more  active  and  assertive  than  the  ones discussed so far, and that lead to conflict resolution-the reduction of  disagreements  that  persist  over  time.  The  conflict  resolution strategies  that  educators  and  teachers  advocate  and  use  usually have two parts (Jones, 2004).[7] First, the strategies involve a way of  identifying  precisely  what  'the'  problem  is.  Once  this  is  done, they require reminding the student of classroom expectations and rules  without  apology  or  harshness,  but  with  simple  clarity  and assertiveness. When used together, the clarification and assertion can not only reduce conflicts between a teacher and an individual

student,  but  also  provide  a  model  for  other  students  to  consider when they have disagreements of their own.

Step  1 :  Clarify  and  identify  the  problem:  Classrooms  can  be emotional  places  even  when  its  primary  purpose  is  to  promote 'thinking'  rather  than  the  expression  of  feelings  as  such.  The emotional quality can be quite desirable: it can give teachers and students 'passion' for learning and respect or even good feelings for each other. But it can also cause trouble if students misbehave: at those moments negative feelings-annoyance, anger, discomfort-can  interfere  with  understanding  exactly  what  went wrong and how to set things right again.  Allow all involved to calm down and then let each individual state their view of the problem. If the issue is between two students, let each share their side of the story.  If the issue involves you and a student, let the student state his view, and then you share yours.

Step 2 : Active and empathetic listening: Diagnosing accurately the conflict is necessary in order to resolve it.  We need to use 'Active Listening'-attending carefully to all aspects of what a student says and  attempting  to  understand  or  empathize  with  it  as  fully  as possible, even if you do not agree with what is being said (Cooper &amp; Simonds, 2003). Active Listening involves asking a lot of questions in  order  continually to check your understanding. It also involves encouraging  the  student  to  elaborate  or  expand  on  his  or  her remarks, and paraphrasing and summarizing what the student has said in order to check your perceptions of what is being said. It is important not to move too fast toward 'solving' the problem with advice,  instructions,  or  scolding,  even  if  these  are  responses  that you  might,  as  a  teacher,  feel  responsible  for  making.  Responding too soon in these ways can shut down communication prematurely, and leave you with an inaccurate impression of the source of the problem.

Depending on the issue, you may want to use Step 3 or skip this and use Step 4.  For most conflicts that involve two students, we will use Step 4.

Step  3 :  Assertive  discipline  and  'I'  messages:  Once  you  have

listened well enough to understand the student's point of view, it helps to frame your responses and comments in terms of how the student's behavior affects you as a teacher. The comments should have several features:

- They should be assertive-neither passive and apologetic, nor unnecessarily hostile or aggressive. State what the problem is, as matter-of-factly as possible: 'Joe, you are talking while I'm explaining something,' instead of either 'Joe, do you think you could be quiet now?' or 'Joe, be quiet!'
- The comments should emphasize I-messages, which are comments that focus on how the problem behavior is affecting the teacher's ability to teach, as well as how the behavior makes the teacher feel. They are distinct from you-messages, which focus on evaluating the mistake or problem which the student has created. An I-message might be, 'Your talking is making it hard for me to remember what I'm trying to say.' A you-message might be, 'Your talking is rude.'
- The comments should encourage the student to think about the effects of his or her actions on others-a strategy that in effect encourages the student to consider the ethical implications of the actions (Gibbs, 2003). Instead of simply saying, 'When you cut in line ahead of the other kids, that was not fair to them,' you can try saying, 'How do you think the other kids feel when you cut in line ahead of them?'

Step  4 :  Negotiating  a  solution:  The  steps  so  far  describe  ways  of interacting that are desirable, but also fairly specific in scope and limited in duration. In themselves, they may not be enough when conflict persists over time and develops a number of complications or confusing features. A student may persist, for example, in being late  for  class,  in  spite  of  diverse  efforts  by  the  teacher  to  modify this behavior. Two students may persist in speaking rudely to each

other,  even  though  the  teacher  has  mediated  this  conflict  in  the past. Or a student may fail to complete homework, time after time. Because these problems develop over time, and because they may involve repeated disagreements between teacher and student, they can  eventually  become  stressful  for  the  teacher,  for  the  student, and  for  any  classmates  who  may  be  affected.  Their  persistence can tempt a teacher simply to announce or dictate a resolution-a decision that may simply leave everyone feeling defeated, including the teacher.

Often in these situations, it is better to negotiate a solution, which means systematically discussing options and compromising on one if  possible.  Negotiation  always  requires  time  and  effort,  though usually not as much as continuing to cope with the original problem, and the results can be beneficial to everyone. A number of experts on conflict resolution have suggested strategies for negotiating with students about persistent problems (Davidson &amp; Wood, 2004). The suggestions vary in detail but usually include some combination of the steps we have already discussed above, along with a few others.

- Decide as accurately as possible what the problem is-Usually this step involves a lot of the active listening described above.
- Brainstorm possible solutions, and then consider their effectiveness-Remember to include students in this step; otherwise, you are simply imposing a solution on others, which is not what negotiation is supposed to achieve.
- Choose a solution, if possible by consensus-Complete agreement on the choice may not be possible, but strive for it as best you can. Remember that taking a vote may be a democratic, acceptable way to settle differences in many situations. If feelings are running high, however, voting has an ironic by-product: it simply allows individuals to 'announce' their differences to each other and therefore maintain the conflict.

- Pay attention later to how well the solution works-For many reasons, things may not work out the way you or the students hope or expect, and you may need to renegotiate the solution at a later time.

## Keeping Management Issues in Perspective

There are two messages from this chapter. One is that management issues  are  important,  complex,  and  deserve  any  teacher's  serious attention.  The  other  is  that  management  strategies  exist  and  can reduce,  if  not  eliminate,  management  problems  when  and  if  they occur. We have explained what some of those strategies are-including some intended to prevent problems from happening and others intended to remedy problems if they do occur.

But there is a third message that this chapter cannot convey by itself: that good classroom management is not an end in itself, but a means for creating a climate where learning happens as fully as possible. During the stress of handling problem behaviors, there is sometimes a risk of losing sight of this idea. Quiet listening is never a goal in itself, for example; it is desirable only because (or when) it allows students to hear the teacher's instructions or classmates' spoken comments, or because it allows students to concentrate on their work or assignments better. There may, therefore, actually be moments when quiet listening is not important to achieve, such as during a 'free choice' time in an elementary classroom or during a period of group work in a middle school classroom. As teachers, we  need  to  keep  this  perspective  firmly  in  mind.  Classroom management should serve students' learning, and not the other way around.

## 10. What Makes an Effective Teacher?

JENNIFER BEASLEY AND MYRA HAULMARK

Here's  a  question:   Are  you teaching if students are not learning? Professionals have debated this idea for generations. A common definition of an effective teacher is  one  who  impacts student learning.

If  educators  are  tasked  with helping children learn, it is important  to  define  learning.

![Image](output_md\Introduction-to-Education-1701296386_artifacts\image_000050_fe86e01e3ae00ba857688a5e2fa49be197057c4db0d953673c134b2676f7181b.png)

Our brain was designed to question, explore and learn. We are born with  billions  of  neurons  just  waiting  to  be  connected.   Each experience we have, throughout our lifetime, creates connections or  pathways between the neurons.   Learning begins at birth and continues throughout a lifetime.

In  order  for  our  brains  to  function  effectively,  it  needs  to  have the following:  exercise, sleep, oxygen, hydration (water), and food. We can have the best teacher in the world, but if the brain lacks any  of  these,  the  brain  will  not  function  at  full  capacity.   Think about students who do not receive enough of one or more of these. They  are  at  a  disadvantage  from  the  second  they  step  into  the classroom; before instruction even begins. There are many things that educators can do in schools to provide for some of these basic needs, but more importantly, it is important for educators to know their students well to determine a missing piece.

There are three definitions of learning that are important to know as you define effectiveness as a teacher.

1. Learning is a change in the neuron patterns of the brain.
2. Learning is the ability to use the information after a long period of disuse.
3. Learning is the ability to use the information to problem solve, and/or use it in a different manner or circumstance from which it was learned.

Terry  Doyle  from  Ferris  State  University  says  that  'The  one  who does the work is the one who does the learning.'  Students have to put work and effort into learning the material that is presented to them.  It doesn't just flow into the brain and stay.  The type of work and the amount of effort will vary among our students.  They will have to work harder in some areas than others; you probably already know that based on your own learning experiences.  As teachers, we have to help students discover what types of strategies will work for them.

## An Effective Educator Understands Learning Theories

As the brain takes in information, it will look for patterns, look for similarities and differences, look for relationships and connect the new information to what is already known.  All of these will create new brain connections and can result in learning.  The information goes into the short term memory, but in order for learning to take place it has to make the transfer to long term memory.  Here is how the cycle works:

The teacher shares knowledge the students need to learn.

The  student's  short  term  memory  is  activated  and  records information that is important.

Neurons fire creating networks that represent the new information

If the student does not use the information, or only uses it a few times,  the  neuron-networks  that  represent  that  new  information will break apart and be lost.

If  the  information  is  used  a  great  deal  (reviewed,  applied  and practices),  the  neuron  networks  form  strong  connections  and become part of long term memory and then…

## LEARNING HAS TAKEN PLACE!

You can see that the student has to be actively involved in order for  learning  to  take  place.   Our  responsibility  is  to  help  them develop strategies for making this transfer from short-term memory to long-term memory.

A  very  large  factor  in  learning  is  repetition.   Students  have  to interact with the information over and over. Many of you do not sing your ABCs every day, but if you were asked to, you probably could.

The  reason  is  that  you  really  did  learn  it  several  years  ago.   The information made the transfer from short-term memory to longterm memory.  Just reading an assignment, or listening to a lecture, is  not  enough  to  learn  the  information.   We  have  to  spend  time interacting with the material and in a variety of ways.

First off, we have to be certain the information we are trying to learn is accurate.  Neurons in the brain fire for misinformation as well  as  accurate  information.   If  you  don't  understand  an  idea,  or have questions, be sure to ask them.  Do not assume.  If you do not ask, you run the risk of studying information that is not correct or of doing something incorrectly.  Always be sure the information you are  studying  is  accurate,  and  that  your  students  understand  this idea as well.

Second, students need to take the time to reflect.  Ask how the new information connects to what you already know.  Search your experiences and see if there is one that connects to this idea.  You can use it to help assimilate the new information.  Look back over how  this  information  was  presented  to  you  and  see  if  there  are any connections there that will help you remember.  Ponder how you might use this new information.  Some students find keeping a  reflective  journal  an  effective  strategy  for  them  to  use  when processing new information.  A journal is a tool that will allow them to 'think about' and reflect on the information.  Keep in mind, this may not be effective for everyone.

Another  tool  for  transferring  information  from  the  short-term memory  to  the  long-term  memory  is  review.   Our  review  has  to begin immediately.  We have to look the information over and create strategies for studying.  These will vary greatly among our students. We have to help them discover what learning tools work for them. For example, let's look at learning spelling words.  We have all had the list of spelling words we needed to learn.  We all had our own way of doing it, but most of us just kept spelling the words over and over.  Again, this doesn't work for everyone.  Others find flashcards helpful  or  drawing  graphs  and  diagrams,  writing  songs  or  poems with  the  concepts  to  be  learned  or  creating  games  to  play  with study buddies.  Some students will highlight in their textbooks and write notes in the margins.  The bottom line is that students have to find a way to review the information that works for them.  In some cases, we have to teach our students how to learn.

One review tool is a concept map.  You may also know this as a

graphic organizer or web.  All of these terms refer to basically the same thing.  It is a visual organization of material.   As they create, they  are  interacting  with  the  material  again  (repetition)  and  then they have a tool to use when they review the information.

Re-coding is a very effective tool in learning.  Re-coding involves writing  the  information  you  receive  in  your  own  words.   Taking notes is one way to re-code, as long as you are not copying word for word from a text or PowerPoint.  Keeping a learning journal is another way to re-code information.  Re-coding allows the student to  put  the  ideas  in  his/her  own  words  and  based  on  our  own experiences  with  the  information.   This  improves  learning.   Don't memorize definitions; always read the definition and then write it out in your own words.  These are the words that you will remember and understand. It will also help to make  that transfer of information from the short term memory to the long term memory. Once again, they are interacting with the material a second or third time and we know that repetition is a major key in learning.  These are the types of strategies you can teach your students.

Research  is  showing  that  movement  is  an  important  part  of learning.  The more movement we can incorporate into a classroom, the more likely our students are to stay focused.  This is especially important  for  younger  children  who  have  very  limited  attention spans, and are naturally wired to move.  Students who appear active, or never seem to be able to sit still, are often moving to help keep themselves  focused.   How  many  of  you  doodle  while  listening  to someone talk, or click a pen or tap a foot?  This type of 'fidgeting', whether you realize it or not, is helping your brain to stay focused on  the  task.   For  students  who  are  high  in  bodily-kinesthetic intelligence,  they  need  to  move.     However,  students  are  often punished in class for the very behaviors that will help them learn. Technology has also robbed our children of opportunities to move, yet it is a necessary part of our development.

A  child's  mental  development  is  based  in  part  on  his/her  early motor  development.   The  brain  begins  to  wire  up  its  ability  to process  information  by  wiring  up  the  body's  systems  of  balance,

coordination,  vestibular,  and  motor  development.  What  makes  us move is also what makes us think.  As the brain and body begin to work together  to  process  motor  sequences  and  patterns  such  as rolling over, crawling, walking, and jumping, the brain creates the pathways used for processing sequences in reading and math.

Think  about  these  things.   The  basic  movements  we  learn  as children,  rolling,  crawling/walking,  and  jumping  correspond  with the way information travels in the brain:

•

side to side across the corpus callosum

- back to front across the motor
- cortex · up and down from the bottom
- to the top of the brain

Sometimes  we  have  to  'jumpstart'  the  brain  by  doing  the

exercises  I  mentioned  earlier.   You  can  see  how  those  simple movements can help get the brain 'talking to itself.'

We  can  support  learning  by  incorporating  movement  into  our classrooms.  Exercise balls have been shown to be very effective for children who have the need to move.  The balls are used in place of a chair.  The small movement that is needed to keep balanced on the ball is enough to meet the child's need to move.  They can also move a bit on the ball within their defined space.  Allowing children to doodle or fidget also helps. Some students even benefit from a 'fidget.'  This is some object that students can 'play with' while they are listening, studying, and working.  For example, a cushy ball to squeeze, or a small ball to roll around in the hand.

You also want to think about activities you can put into place that will  allow  students  to  move.   Using  a  velcro  dartboard  with  math facts is one way to get students moving.  They throw the velcro dart and have to solve the problem it lands on.  Labeling a beach ball with the elements of a story and tossing the ball around.  The elements

their  hands  land  on  when  catching  it  are  the  elements  they  have to explain or give examples of.  These types of things will increase the chances that this information will be transferred to long-term memory.

## An Effective Educator Understands About Mindset

There  is  another  significant  factor  in  learning  and  that  is  an individual's mindset.  Carol Dweck's research identified two types of mindsets:  a growth mindset and a fixed mindset.  These mindsets influence how students view themselves as learners and influence the amount of effort they put into their studies.

Growth mindset individuals believe their brains are malleable and intelligence and abilities can be enhanced through hard work and practice.  They  believe  only  time  will  tell  how  'smart'  they  are. Fixed mindset individuals see intelligence as fixed; some people are 'smart'  and  others  are  not  'smart.'   They  believe  that  no  amount of  work  or  study  will  improve  their  abilities  or  increase  their knowledge. Both of these mindsets are reflected in the performance of students.  Let's look at these ideas side by side.

You can see how the way in which you view yourself will impact your  ideas  about  learning  and  thus  your  practices.   It's  vital  that we help students develop a growth mindset if they are going to be successful.

Let's  look  at  the  basic  principle  of  learning.   In  order  to  learn, we have to take a risk and in order to take that risk,  we  have  to feel  safe  both  physically  and  emotionally.   Most  of  our  students feel  physically  safe  in  their  classrooms  (there  are  always  those exceptions), but far fewer feel emotionally safe. They  don't participate in discussions, answer questions, or sometimes even do their work out of the fear of being wrong.   Most of these students will have a fixed mindset.  They don't see themselves as learners and they don't believe that any amount of work will make a difference. They often shut down and do nothing because it is emotionally safer that  way.   It  is  safer  to  do  nothing  than  to  do  something  and  be wrong, which means they then deal with the humiliation of failure. They have often experienced a great deal of failure in the past and they have now 'shut down.' If someone does not step in and help them experience success, they are doomed.  It's never too late to

help  a  student  develop  a  growth  mindset,  but  it  will  take  time, patience, and dedication.

If  we  have  any  hope  of  these  students  into  productive  students who participate in discussions, complete work, and make academic progress  we  have  to  first  help  them  experience  success.   This requires  a  one-on-one  conversation  to  discover  the  reason  why these things are happening.  We then have to work to resolve the issues the student has.  They may mean we provide extra help to the student individually, alter assignments for a period of time, work with study buddies, or do whatever it will take for the student to experience just a small amount of success.  With each new success comes  more  confidence.   We  then  continue  to  build  on  that success.   We  have  to  continue  to  challenge  them,  but  keep  the support  systems  in  place  so  they  can  continue  to  be  successful. Over time we will be able to remove some of those supports, but in  the  process,  they  will  be  gaining  strategies  and  tools  they  can continue to use in their academic endeavors.  They will also have gained  confidence  and  most  of  them  will  have  changed  their mindset to one that more closely resembles a growth mindset.  This will make all the difference in their learning!

Learning is a complex process and we have to understand what is involved, what works for our students, the challenges they face, the emotional baggage they enter our classrooms with, as well as understand  them  and  find  ways  to  help  them  be  successful.   We

have to be willing to go above and beyond, change the rules and expectations now and then, and get rid of the notion of punishment, and strive to teach!

## An Effective Educator Understands How to Reflect

As a teacher learns about how children learn, he/she can reflect on how he/she is doing to help children learn.  Reflective teaching is one way that an educator can systematically reflect on data (test scores, assignments, informal questions) to determine if he/she was successful.  It is important to think about all that goes into teaching a lesson so that reflection can be centered on what might be going well and what might need adjustment.

## Danielson's Framework for Teaching

Dr.  Charlotte  Danielson  (2011)  worked  with  others  and  current research to define a framework to identify a teacher's responsibilities. Although they are not the only possible description of  practice,  these  responsibilities  seek  to  define  what  teachers should know and be able to do in the exercise of their profession.

In this framework, the complex activity of teaching is divided into 22 components clustered into the following 4 domains of teaching responsibility:

- Domain 1: Planning and Preparation
- Domain 2: The Classroom Environment
- Domain 3: Instruction
- Domain 4: Professional Responsibilities

Each component defines a distinct aspect of a domain; two to five elements describe a specific feature of a component. For example, Domain 2, The Classroom Environment, contains five components. Component 2a is Creating an Environment of Respect and Rapport, which consists of two elements: 'Teacher interaction with students' and  'Student  interactions  with  other  students.'  This  component applies in some  manner  to  all  settings,  as  do  all  the  other components. But although teachers at all levels and in all subjects establish rapport with and convey respect for their students, they do so in different ways.

Danielson's Framework  for  Teaching  (FfT) is one  way  that educators in many states have adopted a common language to talk about the responsibilities in the classroom.  States such as Arkansas and Louisiana have adopted Danielson's work in order to evaluate a teacher's success in the classroom.

## Thoughts

Think about how you describe an effective teacher.  Would these four domains capture everything you are thinking about?

## What Makes an Effective Teacher?

In this chapter, we reflected on three things that effective educators need to understand.  They need to understand how children learn and  grow,  they  have  to  learn  about  the  impact  of  mindset  on learning, and finally, they need to know how to reflect on their own practice.   With  these  practices  in  place,  educators  will  be  on  the road to teacher expertise.

## 11. What Can a New Teacher Expect?

JENNIFER BEASLEY AND MYRA HAULMARK

Why do teachers teach? It is a rather simple question, however, the question 'what is a  teacher,'  must  be  addressed first. Merriam-Webster's definition  of  a  teacher  is  'one whose occupation is to instruct' (Merriam-Webster, 2008,  para.  1).  That  is  a  rather one-dimensional definition of a

teacher, as teachers these days offer so much more to the class than just the information; they offer themselves. A collective definition of a  teacher  is  someone  who  'yearns  to  help  children  learn,  watch them grow, and make a meaningful difference in the world' (Teacher Support Network, 2007, para. 2). This definition must be the main reason why individuals pursue teaching as a career. Generally, the pay is low to fair, but the overall rewards are much greater.  As a teacher, one can touch the hearts of the young and open their minds in order to tap their thirst for knowledge.

## Objectives and Key Terms

## In this chapter, readers will…

- Discuss why the act of instructing students can be a stumbling block for new teachers.
- Explain why new teachers often have difficulties with parents who should be their natural allies.
- Summarize the chief strategies that can contribute to a successful first year of teaching

## Key terms in the chapter are…

- Culture shock
- Mentor
- Collaboration

Starting  their  career  is  for  most  people  one  of  the  most  exciting and  energizing  periods  of  their  lives.  For  most  young  people,  it represents their unofficial entrance into the adult world. They are often in a new environment with new people and challenges, and they  have  real  responsibilities.  This  is  especially  true  for  new teachers.

For many, the transition into full-time teaching is relatively easy and  satisfying.  For  others,  however,  the  first  year  is  a  struggle. Some new teachers are shocked and disappointed by their initial experience of being a teacher. For most, however, the first year of teaching is a mixed bag of highs and lows. In this chapter, we try to help prospective teachers anticipate some of the problems that

lie ahead. All of the material comes directly from the experiences of beginning teachers.

We have good news and bad news for you. First, the good news: Forecasters  predict  that  as  a  result  of  teacher  retirement  and student enrollment growth, U.S. schools will need about 4 million new teachers between 2013 and 2021.

People entering the teaching profession in the second decade of the twenty-first century typically will have a rich variety of options and  opportunities  from  which  to  choose.  So  much  for  the  good news.

Now  the  bad  news:  The  first  year  of  teaching  can  be  a  rough one-too rough for many beginners. Each year, many new teachers walk  into  their  classrooms  with  energy,  high  hopes,  and  rosecolored glasses, only to face unexpected problems that cause them to give up on teaching or radically lower their perceptions of their capabilities as teachers.

Rather than ignoring or-even worse-sugarcoating these problems, we focus on them, even at the risk of frightening some readers.  We do so because we believe 'forewarned is forearmed,' and many of the problems discussed in this chapter can be either prevented or radically reduced in intensity. Further, new teachers can  actually  find  satisfaction  in  solving  their  problems  and  in succeeding as professionals.

Surprise  is  a  big  part  of  the  first  year  too.  New  teachers  often report their astonishment at this or that experience or event. The first  year  is  intense  because  of  the  unexpected  demands  and  the startling events that lurk in what was thought to be a familiar world: the  classroom.  These  surprises  often  come  wrapped  in  everyday boxes; some contain sweet treasures, and others hold booby traps. These surprises could be organized in the following way:

- The School Environment
- What is the Role of an Administrator?
- Working with Your Fellow Teachers
- Preparing Your Instruction

- Relationships with Students
- Partnering with Parents

In this chapter, we look at each of these categories and try to take some of the surprises out of the first year of teaching. Our larger intention,  however,  is  to  help  you  mobilize  yourself  by  preparing for the problems, developing your strengths, and shoring up your weaknesses.

## The School Environment

One of the  first  obstacles  as  a  new  teacher  is  understanding  the culture  of  the  school.     To  manage  this  culture  shock,  first-year teachers and those new to a school district may be required to go through an orientation.  This can help new teachers feel supported. Whether or not a school provides this, there are a few things new teachers can do to get to know their school better.

- Understand the families and community the school serves. Teachers should learn about and prepare for common challenges faced by students in their schools. For example, some children from underserved communities may need help with non-cognitive skills such as persistence and self-control in order to succeed in school. Talking to administrators and doing independent research can provide insight into what will and won't work with students, and may uncover surprising resources.
- Check classroom readiness. New teachers should visit their classrooms before school starts and run down a list. Are there enough tables and chairs for the expected number of students as well as a teacher's desk? Does the overhead projector work? Is there chalk and/or are there new markers and erasers for the board? Teachers should make sure their classrooms are fully functional; if not, they should alert school staff and make sure problems are corrected.
- Learn safety procedures. Teachers should know all the safety and emergency procedures in their school, from fire drills to lockdowns. Kate Vlchek, a veteran teacher in Aurora, Colorado, warns that new teachers may not receive any hands-on training - just a faculty handbook. Teachers should review these procedures carefully and ask questions to make sure they understand.

## What is the Role of the Administrator?

A  school  administrator,  also known as the school principal, is  the  steward  of  learning  and managing  supervisor  of  their school. They provide vision and leadership to all stakeholders in the school and create a safe and peaceful environment to achieve the mission of learning

and  educating  at  the  highest  level.  They  guide  the  day-to-day school business and oversee all activities conducted by the school. They bear the responsibility of all decision-making and are accountable for their efforts to elevate the school to the best level of learning achievements for the students, best teaching skills for the teachers, and best work environment for support staff.

There are many ways a school administrator can be a wonderful partner for a new teacher.

1. Help new teachers find a good mentor
2. Balance the new teacher's workload
3. Meet with new teachers
4. Be supportive of disciplinary issues
5. Be supportive when parent problems happen
6. They make new teachers a part of their team

## Working with your Fellow Teachers

A number of studies have concluded that induction programs can reduce  teacher  turnover,  improve  teacher  practice,  and  lead  to student  success  provided  the  programs  are  job-embedded  and include appropriate mentoring. Fellow teachers provide the

support and mentoring needed when first starting a new position. Finding  the  right  mentor  for  you  is  essential.   Author,  Jennifer Gonzalez, encourages 'finding your marigold.'  Read this short piece about selecting mentors to help you: https:/ /www.cultofpedagogy.com/marigolds/.

## Preparing Your Instruction

In Chapter 5, we discussed the school curriculum and what is taught in schools.  As new teachers begin to plan the lessons they can be overwhelmed by options.  With little experience in the classroom, it is hard to know just how to plan a lesson or what lessons will look like  over  the  course  of  a  year.   For  an  inside  look  at  this  obstacle and what new teachers can do to help, read the blog 'Countdown to Your First Year, What are Students Supposed to Learn?'

## Relationships with Students

Earlier  on  in  this  resource,  we  learned  a  lot  about  building relationships with students. For more on the power of relationships with students, watch the following short video:

## Partnering with Parents

Partnering with parents can be a challenge for new teachers.  Often this  is  the  first  time  that  the  new  teacher  has  had  the  chance  to meet with parents on their own.  For timely suggestions on how to build positive relationships, read the article 'A Strategy for Building Positive Partnerships with Parents.'

## Teacher Induction

A number of studies have concluded that induction programs can reduce  teacher  turnover,  improve  teacher  practice,  and  lead  to student  success  provided  the  programs  are  job-embedded  and include appropriate mentoring (Smith &amp; Ingersoll 2004, Howe 2006, Wang et al. 2008; Darling-Hammond et al. 2009). According to Howe (2006), the best teacher induction programs are located in Australia, Britain,  Canada,  France,  Germany,  Japan,  New  Zealand,  and  the United States. They have revealed some common attributes that can be instructive for both expert teachers and new teachers. Examples are extended  internship programs, specially trained mentors, comprehensive in-service training, reduced teaching assignments for  beginning  teachers,  and  emphasis  on  assistance  rather  than assessment (Howe, 2006). According to Cherubini (2007) research also suggests that the successful induction of new teachers depends upon having a collegial and collaborative environment in the school (Duncan-Poitier, 2005; Feiman-Nemser, 2003; Ohio Department of Education, 2004; Olebe, 2005).

## Successful Induction Practice

What is induction? Induction is the support and guidance provided

to novice teachers and school administrators in the early stages of their careers. Induction encompasses orientation to the workplace, socialization, mentoring, and guidance through beginning teacher practice.

The  first  year  of  teaching  is  difficult.  New  teachers  recognize that  each  year.  The  most  difficult  part  of  the  first-year  induction process  is  not  by  having  communicated  the  tangible  procedures, but rather not communicating the morass of undocumented rules and  attitudes  that  comprise  institutional  culture.  (Gregory,  1998) During  this  induction  phase,  employers  and  employees  begin relationships that are of fundamental importance in setting standards  and  behavioral  patterns.  Induction  requires  'far  more than just  a  traditional  'information  dump'  if  it  is  to  be  successful. (Gregory, 1998, p. 17)

Successful  induction  practices  have  three  main  objectives:  1.  to help new employees settle into their environment, 2. to help them understand their responsibilities, and 3. to ensure that the organization  receives  the  benefits  of  a  well-trained  and  highly motivated employee as quickly as possible. (Gregory, 1998) Toward this  end,  many  workplaces  appoint  a  'guide',  'peer-coach',  or 'buddy' for the first few weeks. These identified individuals can be significantly more effective if they make a genuine commitment to the values of the institution and the well-being of the new teacher. When considering  the  teacher  induction  process,  it  is  important for one to delineate among the various components. For example, the 'guides' are usually called mentors, and beginning teachers are typically referred to as novices. This mentor-novice relationship is often the focal point of many state and local induction programs. The induction process typically involves three common evolutionary stages: preparation, orientation, and practice. Although these three stages have similar meanings in educational settings,  they  often  have  different  connotations.  The  following 'definition of terms' will delineate between these stages.

## Thoughts

Become  a  new  teacher  takes  energy  and  the  ability  to  access resources needed to grow as a professional.  New teachers reflect on what they do and find ways to learn as they grow.  For a resource on tips for growing as a professional, finish the chapter by reading the following article '4 Tips for New Teachers on Building a Strong Career Foundation.'

As  you  prepare  for  a  career  in  education,  watch  the  following video with these questions in mind:
