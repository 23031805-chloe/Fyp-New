## PART 2

## PATHOGENS

1. The amount of pathogen of the type specified in the first column of the following table that is detected in any ready-to-eat food must be less than the number of colony forming units specified for that pathogen in the second column of the table:
2. Where any ready-to-eat food is a type of ready-to-eat raw seafood, the amount of Vibrio parahaemolyticus detected in the ready-to-eat food must be less than 100 colony forming units per gram (for solid food) or millilitre (for liquid food).

## PART 3 NON-READY-TO-EAT FOOD

1. In this Part -

'non-intact', for a beef product, means a beef product that has been subject to a process (for example, injection with a solution, mechanical tenderisation or comminution) that allows pathogens to penetrate below the beef product's exterior surface into the beef product's interior;

'small consignment' means -

- ( a ) for a consignment of shell eggs, a consignment that does not exceed 10,000 shell eggs; and
- ( b ) for a consignment of any other article of food, a consignment that does not exceed 100 kg or 50 units of the article of food.
2. An article of food complies with a microbiological standard for a pathogen if, for the number of samples specified in the table for that article -
- ( a ) the amount of pathogen in each sample does not exceed the m limit; or
- ( b ) sub-paragraph ( a ) is not satisfied but -
- (i) the number of samples where the amount of pathogen exceeds the m limit does not exceed the c number; and
- (ii) the amount of pathogen in each sample does not exceed the M limit.

## NUTRI-GRADE GRADING SYSTEM

1. A Nutri-Grade beverage may be graded 'A', 'B', 'C' or 'D' in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 6, with 'A' being the best grade and 'D' being the poorest grade.

[S 451/2023 wef 30/12/2023]

2. Subject to paragraphs 5 and 6, the grade of the Nutri-Grade beverage is the poorer of the following:
2. ( a ) the sugar content grade determined according to paragraph 3;
3. ( b ) the saturated fat content grade determined according to paragraph 4.

[S 451/2023 wef 30/12/2023]

3. The sugar content grade is determined according to the following table:
4. The saturated fat content grade is determined according to the following table:
5. Even though a Nutri-Grade beverage's sugar content grade and saturated fat content grade is 'A', the grade of the Nutri-Grade beverage is 'B' if the NutriGrade beverage contains any aspartame, sugar alcohol, carbohydrate alcohol, polyhydric alcohol, or any other substance added in place of sugar to provide a sweet taste.
6. For the purpose of paragraphs 3 and 4 -
5. ( a ) the Nutri-Grade beverage's sugar content is the grams of total sugar per 100 ml of the Nutri-Grade beverage minus the grams of lactose and galactose per 100 ml of the Nutri-Grade beverage;
6. ( b ) the Nutri-Grade beverage's saturated fat content is the grams of saturated fat per 100 ml of the Nutri-Grade beverage; and

## SIXTEENTH SCHEDULE continued

- ( c ) in determining the sugar content and saturated fat content -
- (i) subject to sub-paragraphs (ii), (iii) and (iv), the grams of total sugar, lactose, galactose and saturated fat per 100 ml of the Nutri-Grade beverage are determined -
- (A) for a prepacked Nutri-Grade beverage that is not freshly prepared - by the information on the nutrition information panel on its package; or

[S 451/2023 wef 30/12/2023]

- (B) for a Nutri-Grade beverage that is freshly prepared or sold from an automated beverage dispenser for noncustomisable beverages - by the information that is required on a nutrition information panel for the NutriGrade beverage under regulation 184C(4);

[S 451/2023 wef 30/12/2023]

- (ii) if the information does not state the grams of total sugar or saturated fat, the grams of total sugar or saturated fat (as the case may be) is taken to be zero grams;
- (iii) if the information does not state the grams of lactose or galactose, the grams of lactose or galactose (as the case may be) is taken to be zero grams; and
- (iv) for a Nutri-Grade beverage meant to be reconstituted or diluted with fluids before consumption, '100 ml' means 100 ml of the Nutri-Grade beverage prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions on how to prepare the beverage.
